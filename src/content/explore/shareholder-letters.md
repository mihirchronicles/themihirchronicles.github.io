- [Warren Buffett](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com): historical lessons on buffettology. No need to go to school. This alone will teach you how to handle finances, relationships, ethics and avoiding stupid mistakes especially greed.
- [Jamie Dimon](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/annual-report-proxy.htm): is the CEO of JP Morgan Chase. He is leading one of the largest banks in the world and has a lot to share on banking, economy and policies.
- [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos): if Warren Buffett is for equity then Howard Marks is for fixed income. Both follow the same principles but are involved in managing different asset classes.
- [Larry Fink](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-chairmans-letter): is the CEO of Blackrock, a largest active investing organization. Lot of wisdom in his letters.
- [Seth Klarman](http://1icz9g2sdfe31jz0lglwdu48.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seth-Klarman-Baupost-Group-Letters.pdf): not much out there on Seth Klarman but this is the best resource I could find.
- [Jeff Bezos](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/annual-reports): Amazon. Period.
- [Mark Leonard](https://www.csisoftware.com/category/pres-letters/): is an underdog but one of the most fascinating CEOs out there who have acquired software businesses and managed to grow companies many x times. Buffett of software companies!

- [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/): used to be a VC, helped grow facebook but now following Buffett type partnership. A lot of insight on private market and how moonshot ideas will take over.
