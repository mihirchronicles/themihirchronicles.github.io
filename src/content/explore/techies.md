- [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html): behind Y Combinator. One of the best essays I have come across on various topics but mostly how to operate.
- [Eugene Wei](https://www.eugenewei.com/): a great strategist with very very long form of essays. He has a way of sharing complex topics with a twist. Mostly on how modern economies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. work!
