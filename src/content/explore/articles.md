- [The Mundanity of Excellence](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers): It was written over 20 years ago in which Chambliss defines excellence as “consistent superiority of performance.” Excellence does not mean do more of the same drills and sets, he or she also does things better. That's what counts. Very small differences, consistently practiced, will produce results. 
- [Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII): This is so good by Bret Victor. “I'm going to talk about following a principle — finding a principle for your work, something you believe is important and necessary and right, and using that to guide what you do.”

- [Productivity](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity): Sam Altman shares his thoughts on optimizing productivity. What hit home for me was just like how money compounds, making incremental productivity hacks can also compound. Sleep was a big one! I no longer preach "sleep when I die" attitude. It is actually completely opposite today. If I don't get enough sleep, my body really feels the pain.
- [Geeks, mops and sociopaths](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths): this one was fascinating about how things take off and the role geeks, mops and sociopaths play a role. This can be applied to so many things, especially the digital coin trend.
- [Death is optional](https://www.edge.org/conversation/yuval_noah_harari-daniel_kahneman-death-is-optional): I am a huge fan of Yuval and his work on Homo Sapiens. And there is no one better than Daniel Kahneman to lead the discussion on access to medicine and the society's role. Sad to say, it does not surprise me there will be inequality in health care just how we are facing income inequality today.
- [The cost conundrum](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum): Atul Gawande does an exceptional job explaining how healthcare cost varies in two seprate towns in Texas for the same treatment. A long but worth the read to understand the health care issues in America.
- [1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): no more chasing millions and 20x growth rate because a creator's job is to find the true fans. There is so much joy in finding the first 1000 true fans.
- [Sick systems](http://www.issendai.com/psychology/sick-systems.html): 4 rules on sick systems which shows you how to keep someone with you forever.
- [LTM](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html): I have a personal fascination with long term memory and I still haven't cracked the code yet but I am a huge believer in space repition and its benefits. Michael Nielsen does a great job covering space repition techniques using the tool called Anki.
- [Luck vs hard work](https://jamesclear.com/luck-vs-hard-work): can't get any simpler than the title itself. A great piece on luck vs hard work.
- [Peter Thiel cs183 essays](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup): Peter Thiel is one of the most outcry and an independent thinker. These notes capture his wisdom he shared during one of the CS183 lecture on startups.

- [Stay in the game](https://www.albertbridgecapital.com/drew-views/2019/6/17/stay-in-the-game): this one is emotional and hit home for me. We all have demons but Max had demons which were beyond his control. He stayed in the game and kept battling. A must read!
