## I. Law of Productivity

_Time Spent = Deliberate Practice_

_High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent x Intensity of Focus_

## II. Solving big problems

Break down problems into smaller problems. Supply X number of inputs for one set of smaller problem. Aptitude is different than knowledge. Knowledge can be taught but learning how to think (aptitude) can take a work of work to overcome. 

## III. Dilberate practice

- Step 1: active learning, always opt for active (read physical books) form of learning as opposed to passive (listen to audible) form of learning
- Step 2: Focused mode: pomodoro chunking with diffused mode: exercise, mental exercise and break in between
- Step 3: Feynman Technique: There are four simple steps:
    - choose a concept and think very hard with repetitive review
    - teach it to a toddler (teach to deepen your learning concepts and sharing will catch a blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are smartly focused on the topic)
    - identify gaps and go back to the source material
    - review and simplify
- Step 4: spaced repetition to move from working memory to long term and  recall - index cards for retrieval
- Step 5: visual metaphors or analogy to map images to learning or analogies like Syria with cereal
- Step 6: memory palace technique to map physical locations like home to learning concepts
- Step 7: mnemonics to remember list
- Step 8: multi-disciplinary approach to transfer of knowledge from one discipline and applying it to another
- Step 9: analytical lens - do not trust assertions and arguments which constitutes the teacher's message without analyzing. Know what author's incentives are. Be a demanding student and an inspectional reader to make up your mind on where you stand
- Step 10: Test, use scoring system to evaluate yourself. Understanding does not mean expertise. Test, Review and Revise

## IV. Einstellung

Einstellung is an enemy of creativity. Don’t get hung up on your intuition and old ideas. Step 3.2 and 3.3 abover will also deepen your creativity.

## V. Chemicals Imbalances

We all experience chemical imbalances if we work too much or not exercise or not spend time with loved ones. How to fix chemical imbalances or get back in the flow?

- Cortisol: presence of stress; follow the tips below
- Endorphins: exercise
    - It’ll help you power through a dreadful task after working out. This works for two reasons. First, the endorphin rush just feels great. You’re more tolerant of pain. Second, since you have recently completed a “challenging activity”, your mind is more readily willing to predict that you’ll complete another.
- Dopamine: complete a task by using music and/or coffee
    - Use a particular playlist you use when you need energy. These are songs that you love but don’t listen to frequently.
    - Use the right amount of coffee will put ypu in a great mood. Too much and you will get jittery. Experiment and find what works for you.
- Serotonin: help others without expecting anything in return
- Oxytocin: spend time with loved ones
