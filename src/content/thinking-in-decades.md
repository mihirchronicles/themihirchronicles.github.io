Work in progress.

As I enter the fourth decade of my time on this planet, planning monthly or yearly goals are no longer relevant. Instead shifting my mind towards thinking in decades. This allows to re-orient myself towards long-term thinking, working towards mastery, staying humble and steering away from distractions. This also sets a sense of urgency on how to spend time because there are only handful of decades left. But before I move forward, few things I have learned in the last decade.

Many view **ignorance** as negative, but in my opinion, ignorance can serve well if used appropriately. This is mostly due to the ego not in check but it is all part of learning and growing. I didn't get a stable job after college because I thought I could start a company and travel the world to find my place in this world. But traveling and meeting people from outside of my bubble clarified what success meant to me.

Starting a company was a dream because a glory such as this is what the West demands. Little did I know, starting a company is hard, keeping it alive is even harder. If I knew the limitations, I would have never tried in the first place. Being ignorant paid off in a way! Learning to find people to work on a piece of project (making a marketing video, building a physical product, growing social media community, product packaging, etc.), bringing a project to life, and selling the product after its born, are the skills I would've never learned otherwise. Lastly, fear never crossed my mind because I was too busy being ignorant. Nothing phased me!

Today, I somewhat despise ignorance but I am glad I got that window to live in such a way. Everyone gets a limited window in their lives to be ignorant and everyone should take advantage of that because it allows everyone to wander and explore.

Growing up, I had areas of interest I wanted to pursue but nothing with a strong conviction. I was naturally drawn to stock investing from an early age. As I was graduating from college, the world was recovering from the Great Recession. Prospects in the industry were low or rarely available. Rather than seeking a stable career, I **wandered** around and **explored**. Signing myself up for bootcamps, meeting people over coffee, learning to build products, starting a company, learning to write code, moving away from family and friends and so much more. 

**Deep curiosity** drove me to learn anything that came my way but not follow the story we are told in the West — chase money, power and awards. Such stories are found in every corner of our society but I refused to partake in it. Instead, I plan on following the side trail because the main trail is too crowded. But the side trail is filled with dead ends and random. But this is where I grew the most — learning to deal with setbacks. I choose not to use the word “failure” because it is really not a failure but a byproduct of deep curiosity.

While wandering around, I found an incredible love for the mountains and being out in the woods. More importantly, learned to live in **solitude**, getting to know my soul and mind. Self-awareness was a gift I got early on in my life. Greeks lived this life of “know thyself.” Being aware of my limitation was as important as knowing my aptitude. While I am out hiking, watching the strange alpine trees, weird shaped rocks and tall mountains makes me realize how marvelous our mother nature is. There is always this question on the back of my mind, where does ambition come from? I don't know the answer but being out in the wilderness makes me think for myself instead of conforming to the world. Ambition can only come when I can think for myself. Then wilderness becomes a necessity!

Lastly, all of these experiences circled me back to one thing — the joy of **creation** and **building**. Why create when there is so much out there? We don't stop planting trees because there are so many trees out there. Building is like planting a seed and nurturing a plant to grow. There is this sense of connection, a deep connection which is hard to explain but when I feel it, there is incredible amount of energy and passion.
