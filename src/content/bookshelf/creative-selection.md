#### [I. Brief Summary]

* Ken Kocienda shares his experience of building software products and product development culture at Apple. He shared his experience of what it took to build Safari web browser and iPhone's keyboard. Both were high-profile features and products which brought Ken in direct contact with Steve Jobs.

#### [II. Big Ideas]

- Ken identifies 7 elements essential to Apple's software success. The following is not a checklist but general pricniples.
    - Inspiration: thinking big ideas and imagining what might be possible
    - Collaboration: working together well with other people and seeking to combine your complementary strenghts
    - Craft: applying skill  to achieve high-quality results and always striving to do better
    - Diligence: doing the necessary grunt work and never sorting to shortcuts or half measures
    - Decisiveness: making tough choices and refusing to delay or procrastinate
    - Taste: developing a refined sense of judgement and finding the balance that produces a pleasing and integrated whole
    - Empathy: trying to see the world from other people's perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs
- Demoing product features was instrumental part of product development at Apple. Demos served as the primary means to turn ideas into software.
- Demos kept churning out that could eventually be shown to Steve which meant day-to-day software development work became a pyramid of demo reviews. Steve Jobs involvement in demos kept the progress and momentum going.
- Decisiveness was crucial so every demo review had a decider, the person with the sole authority to approve or not.
- Every major feature on the iPhone started as a demo, and for a demo to be useful, it had to be concrete and specific.
- Demoing features was intimidating because it was an emotional roller coster. Mostly the high item features were showcased to Steve Jobs and higher executives. Often the feedback given would not be positive and people would have to go back to drawing board.
- The most significant strand of Apple's product development DNA was to meld technology and liberal arts, to take the latest software or hardware, mix them with elements of design and culture, and produce features and products that people found useful and meaningful in their everyday lives.
- Steve never wanted Apple software to overload people especially when they might already be stretched by the bustle of their daily lives. He believed stripping away nonessential featres made products easier for people to learn from the start and easier to use over time. He wanted products and their software to speak for themselves.
- Ken shares a great story of when Lombardi joined Packers in 1959. Lombardi's focus on intense quest for perfection was the Power Sweep. Every single move of a single play was the idea behind Power Sweep. To beat the Packers, you must beat the Power Sweep. The same analogy goes for product development. Lombardi connected his words and his team's action in football by focusing on one simple play.
- Ken discusses deeper about bein empathetic and a good taste. Taste often requires trust and finding balance. Ken omits out beauty because design is not about being visually attractive but a well thoughtout solution.
- Ken explains the idea of convergence and shares the story of how Google factored out taste from its design process. When it comes to picking color, just pick one. Don't waste your time doing A/B test for colors. Use your good taste, knowledge, make the product accessible and move on. Apple always made quick choices about small details. Apple took more time on bigger questions. Always make a steady progress by showcasing demos, getting feedback, and following-up with more demos till it shapes product overtime. It is all about incremental progress like Charles Darwin.
- Chapter 8-10 should be read in its entirety.
