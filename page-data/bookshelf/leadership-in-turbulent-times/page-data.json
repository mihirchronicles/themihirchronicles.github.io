Brief Summary</h2>\n<p>Doris Goodwin is a presidential historian and does an amazing job covering four presidents: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. The book is divided into three categories: ambition and early recognition of leadership ability; adversity and growth; and how they led during crises in their presidencies. Goodwin poses several questions early on to set the stage for the book. Are leaders born or made? Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Do the times make the leader or does the leader shape the leader shape the times? How can a leader infuse a sense of purpose and meaning into people's lives? What is the difference between power, title, and leadership? Is leadership possible without a purpose larger than personal ambition? These questions are worth exploring for anyone who is curious about leadership in turbulent times. This is a fascinating walkthrough of American history.</p>\n<h2>II. Big Ideas</h2>\n<h2>III.
