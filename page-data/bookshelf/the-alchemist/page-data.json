Brief Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pablo Coelho shares the story of a shepherd boy from the Spanish province of Andalusia who dreams of travelling the world in search of a treasure as desirable as any ever found.

We grow up with this idea, and as the years accumulate, so too do the layers of prejudice, fear and guilt. Our personal calling is so deeply buried in our soul as it is invisible.</li>\n<li>Love is the second obstacle. We know what we want to do, but are afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream. But people who love us will accompany our journey.</li>\n<li>Fear of defeats will meet on the path so it is better not to follow the dream.</li>\n<li>The fear of realizing the dream for which we have not been fighting all our lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Part I.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Santiago was originally trained to be a priest but wanting to see the world, he became a shepherd\nWent to a dream interpreter and a year later in the same village is the girl he loved.
