Brief Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dale Carnegie’s work is masterpiece of self-help and persuasive writing. Although not a fan of self-help books, the classic (1936) covers genuine lessons on how to treat others respectfully and graciously. More importantly, I enjoyed learning about history that was relevant during 1930s. Carnegie uncovers lessons learned by industrialists, presidents, authors, creatives, professors, middle-managers and so many more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>II. Big Ideas</h2>\n<h3>Don't criticize, condemn or complain.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.</li>\n<li>Criticism is dangerous, because it wound a person's precious pride, hurts the sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</li>\n<li>B.F. Skinner experiment found animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.</li>\n<li>Abraham Lincoln's personal incident in life taught him the most invaluable lessons in art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter or ridicule anyone. During the Civil War, when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: “Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.” Lincoln would write letters to his Generals when he was not happy with the outcomes, but the Generals would never see those letters. Why? Because he would never mail them. These letter were found after his death. Lincoln put the letters aside, for he had learned by one experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility. A nice trick to reduce giving criticisms is to pull out a $5 bill and look at Lincoln's face, and ask: “What would Lincoln do?”</li>\n<li>Mark Twain used similar tricks like Abraham Lincoln. He would lose his temper occasionally and write letters to blow off steam, and the letters didn't do real harm. The letters were never mailed because his wife secretly lifted them out of the mail.</li>\n<li>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</li>\n<li>Benjamin Franklin in his own words at an early age, “I will speak ill of no man and speak all good I know of everybody.”</li>\n<li>Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain— and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</li>\n<li>Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism, “Father Forgets.” It's about a father who realizes that he had only criticized his boy when the little boy was just doing his thing.</li>\n<li>Instead of condeming people, try to understand them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give honest, sincere appreciation.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sigmund Freud said that everything that you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.</li>\n<li>John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosophers said that the deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.</li>\n<li>Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.”</li>\n<li>William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”</li>\n<li>Feeling appreciated is human hunger. Animals don't have a desire to feel important but the humans do.</li>\n<li>Rockefeller gave his employees the feeling of importance because he knew the value of it. When one of his partners lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad guy in South America, he might have criticized; but he knew he had done his best to save 60 percent of the money Rockefeller had invested. Instead of criticizing, he praised his parter for saving the money.</li>\n<li>There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined (this statement was made in 1936 and we are still facing the issue). What is the cause of the insanity? No one knows for sure, but according to this doctor with high honors attributed this insanity to a feeling of unimportant that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality.</li>\n<li>Charles Schwab was one of the highest paid American business executive in 1921. Andrew Carnegie paid him a salary over million dollars. Schwab credited this success largely because of his ability to deal with people. In his own words, “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. The greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”</li>\n<li>Most people do opposite of what Schwab did.</li>\n<li>A man was asked by his wife to list six things she could do to become a better wife. The man asked for some time to think about it and give her the answer next morning. The next morning, the wife receieved six red roses with a note saying: “I can't think of six things I would like to change about you. I love the way you are.” The wife teared up when she greeted the husband at the door.</li>\n<li>In the long run, flattery will do more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else. The difference between flattery and appreciation is simple: one is sincere and the other is insincere, one comes with heart out and the other from teeth out, one is selfish and the other is unselfish and one is universally admired and the other is not.</li>\n<li>Nothing pleases children more than the parental interest and approval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Arouse in the other person as eager want.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. If you don't want your children to smoke, don't preach at them, and don't talk what you want, but show them that how smoking can keep them from making the basketball team.</li>\n<li>Why do people make donation to Red Cross? Because they want to feel good about themselves. If they had not wanted that feeling more than they wanted money, they would have not made the donation.</li>\n<li>When people are dissatified with customer service, they last out at them. Instead of sympathizing with them, they threaten them. To resolve the issues you must understand the point of view of other side. Henry Ford said: “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.” </li>\n<li>When a large corporation communicates with their employees, many fail to understand the desire of their employees. Who cares what the company wants? Employees are worried about their own problems: mortgage, healthcare, family, etc.</li>\n<li>Salespeople are pounding people with goods and services without thinking what their customers want.</li>\n<li>The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to server others has an enormous advantage and little competition.</li>\n<li>The author ask his readers if there is one thing that needs to be taken away from this book, it is this: an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle.</li>\n<li>Negotiation is not a zero-sum game. Each party should gain from negotiation.</li>\n<li>Parents often make mistakes on understanding what their kids want.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Become genuinely interested in people.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dog is the only animal that doesn't have to work for a living. A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving nothing but love.</li>\n<li>If the author doesn't like people, people won't like his or her stories.</li>\n<li>Theodore Roosevelt greeted all the White House servants by name, even the scullery maids. When Roosevelt visited the White House after his term, the head usher said with tears: “It is the only happy day we had in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar bill.”</li>\n<li>If we want to make friends, let's greet people with animation and enthusiasm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Smile.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Charles Schwab once said his smile had been worth a million bucks. A baby's smile has the same effect.</li>\n<li>There's far more information in a smile than a frown. That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.</li>\n<li>You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.</li>\n<li>Smile when you don't feel like doing so. Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.</li>\n<li>It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Abe Lincoln once said: “Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.”</li>\n<li>Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies.</li>\n<li>Chinese proverb: “A man without a smiling face must open a shop.” Your smile is a messenger of a good will.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jim Farley diliberately remembered everyone's name (50,000 people) that came across him. Why is he important? Because he was the campaign manager for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Without him, Roosevelt would've not made it to White House.</li>\n<li>Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. </li>\n<li>You gain compliment when you recall someone's name, but you have a sharp disadvantage when you forget or misspell it.</li>\n<li>Andrew Carnegie discovered a rabbit and a whole nest of little rabbits as a young boy. But he didn't have enough food for the new born rabbits. So he told the boys and girls in the neighborhood that if they would out and pull enough clover and dandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in their honor.</li>\n<li>Carnegie translated the same psychology into business world. He would name steel mills after his clients. This is how he won deals. This was a secret to Andrew Carnegie's leadership.</li>\n<li>Names are so important that major universities take in donations and name the buildings after the doner.</li>\n<li>In politics, recalling a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.</li>\n<li>Napoleon, the Thirds, Emperor of France diliberately remembered everyone's name. If he didn't catch the name, he would ask the person to repeat it again. He would even go one step further by asking how is it spelled. During the conversation, he would repeat the name several times and associate it with features, expression and general appearance for easy recall.</li>\n<li>Remembering names takes time and that is why many don't do it. Emerson said: “Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How to have an interesting conversation? Listen intently with geunine interest.</li>\n<li>Harvard president, Charles W.Eliot once said: “There is no mystery about successful business intercourse....Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.” You don't have to study for four years in Harvard to discover that.</li>\n<li>Listening is not silence, but an activity by listening attentively, patiently waiting for your turn and not letting the temptation of interrupting kick in. This allows the other person to get into receptive mood.</li>\n<li>Lincoln would invite his neighbor from Springfield to DC just so his neighbor could listen. This was Lincoln's way of saying things out loud by doing all the talking himself.</li>\n<li>Isaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of celebrities thought many people fail to make a favorable impression becasue they don't listen attentively. They are concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Talk in terms of other person's interest</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Roosevelt knew that all leaders royal road to people's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>III.
