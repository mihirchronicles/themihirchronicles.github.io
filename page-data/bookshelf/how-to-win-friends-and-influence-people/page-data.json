Brief Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dale Carnegie’s work is masterpiece of self-help and persuasive writing. Although not a fan of self-help books, the classic (1936) covers genuine lessons on how to treat others respectfully and graciously. More importantly, I enjoyed learning about history that was relevant during 1930s. Carnegie uncovers lessons learned by industrialists, presidents, authors, creatives, professors, middle-managers and so many more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>II. Big Ideas</h2>\n<h3>Don't criticize, condemn or complain.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.</li>\n<li>Criticism is dangerous, because it wound a person's precious pride, hurts the sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</li>\n<li>B.F. Skinner experiment found animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.</li>\n<li>Abraham Lincoln's personal incident in life taught him the most invaluable lessons in art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter or ridicule anyone. During the Civil War, when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: “Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.” Lincoln would write letters to his Generals when he was not happy with the outcomes, but the Generals would never see those letters. Why? Because he would never mail them. These letter were found after his death. Lincoln put the letters aside, for he had learned by one experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility. A nice trick to reduce giving criticisms is to pull out a $5 bill and look at Lincoln's face, and ask: “What would Lincoln do?”</li>\n<li>Mark Twain used similar tricks like Abraham Lincoln. He would lose his temper occasionally and write letters to blow off steam, and the letters didn't do real harm. The letters were never mailed because his wife secretly lifted them out of the mail.</li>\n<li>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</li>\n<li>Benjamin Franklin in his own words at an early age, “I will speak ill of no man and speak all good I know of everybody.”</li>\n<li>Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain— and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</li>\n<li>Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism, “Father Forgets.” It's about a father who realizes that he had only criticized his boy when the little boy was just doing his thing.</li>\n<li>Instead of condeming people, try to understand them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give honest, sincere appreciation.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sigmund Freud said that everything that you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.</li>\n<li>John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosophers said that the deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.</li>\n<li>Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.”</li>\n<li>William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”</li>\n<li>Feeling appreciated is human hunger. Animals don't have a desire to feel important but the humans do.</li>\n<li>Rockefeller gave his employees the feeling of importance because he knew the value of it. When one of his partners lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad guy in South America, he might have criticized; but he knew he had done his best to save 60 percent of the money Rockefeller had invested. Instead of criticizing, he praised his parter for saving the money.</li>\n<li>There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined (this statement was made in 1936 and we are still facing the issue). What is the cause of the insanity? No one knows for sure, but according to this doctor with high honors attributed this insanity to a feeling of unimportant that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality.</li>\n<li>Charles Schwab was one of the highest paid American business executive in 1921. Andrew Carnegie paid him a salary over million dollars. Schwab credited this success largely because of his ability to deal with people. In his own words, “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. The greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”</li>\n<li>Most people do opposite of what Schwab did.</li>\n<li>A man was asked by his wife to list six things she could do to become a better wife. The man asked for some time to think about it and give her the answer next morning. The next morning, the wife receieved six red roses with a note saying: “I can't think of six things I would like to change about you. I love the way you are.” The wife teared up when she greeted the husband at the door.</li>\n<li>In the long run, flattery will do more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else. The difference between flattery and appreciation is simple: one is sincere and the other is insincere, one comes with heart out and the other from teeth out, one is selfish and the other is unselfish and one is universally admired and the other is not.</li>\n<li>Nothing pleases children more than the parental interest and approval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Arouse in the other person as eager want.</h3>\n<h3>Become genuinely interested in people.</h3>\n<h3>Smile.</h3>\n<h3>Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</h3>\n<h3>III. Quotes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For the great aim of education, is not knowledge but action. — Herbert Sepencer</li>\n<li>Let's realize criticisms are like homing pigeons.
