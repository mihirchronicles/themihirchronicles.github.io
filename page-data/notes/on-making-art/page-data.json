In elementary school, I enjoyed crayons and a sketchbook. I was never good, but the constant chase of making something with pen and paper made me forget real-world problems. An underlying reason which I found art very therapeutic at an early age.</p>\n<p>Things got in the way so I abandoned my crayons and sketchpad.</p>\n<p>In college during my final quarter, I took some creative classes. I didn't need the GPA boost, but I was missing some credits before I couldn't graduate. This forced me to explore classes I would enjoy without having to worry about grades or requiring extra motivation to study for tests. One was <em>Music Theory 101</em> and the other one was <em>Art 101</em>. I don't remember anything about music theory, but I do remember things I drew, painted and sketched in my art class. To this day (after 8 years), I periodically go over my sketchpad that I used during the class.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Covid hit in 2020 and I picked up on making art again after work and during the weekends. Suddenly, I realized how therapeutic drawing was. I forgot about everything that was going around me. To come to realizaton on a hobby that makes you forget your surroundings and problems was very powerful to me. Making art is like meditating with a pen which requires no typing or browsing endlessly on devices. It requires singular focus. Below are some of the sketches from 2020 quarantining.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 970px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/aa440/art.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.33333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"artwork\" title=\"artwork\" src=\"/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/587b0/art.png\" srcset=\"/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/8aea6/art.png 243w,\n/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/44c61/art.png 485w,\n/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/587b0/art.png 970w,\n/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/5b795/art.png 1455w,\n/static/9f260ded89bb594318a198439c6b21f0/aa440/art.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>Art is contextual. It depends on so many conditions such as emotions, interests, perspectives, local issues, global issues and more. Art uncovers stigma, truth and propaganda. It is inspiring and moving. There is something else about making art which is getting lost in the process and letting your imagination play out. It is an iterative process which never stops. To say the least, work of an artist is never completed only abandoned.</p>\n<p>I have emulated my sketches from contemporary artists such as Oliver Jeffers and Jean Julian. Though, I am obsessed with Oliver Jeffers. His work takes me back to childhood which I can't really explain why. His work is poetic in some sense which addresses ongoing issues of the world. His illustrations and stories are fundamental that can be undestood both by a kid and an adult. Curiosity and humor are underlying themes of his work which I am drawn to in real life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him. We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth. — JFK</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced. — Vincent Van Gogh</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"06 July, 2020","path":"/notes/on-making-art","title":"On Making Art"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
