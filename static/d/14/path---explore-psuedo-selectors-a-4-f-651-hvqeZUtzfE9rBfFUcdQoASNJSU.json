{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I only just found out that <code class=\"language-text\">::before</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">:before</code>) and <code class=\"language-text\">::after</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">:after</code>) are pseudo elements, which are different from pseudo classes. Both of these are grouped under pseudo selectors. I like this quote from MDN ~</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even the most skilled web developers are still amazed by what's possible using selectors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>pseudo selectors are only two types of selectors. The others are: simple selectors, attribute selectors, multiple selectors and combinators. All of these help us to target and style HTML elements.</p>\n<p>So, pseudo selectors include both pseudo elements and pseudo classes. They are added to the end of other selectors, and don't apply to whole elements, only parts of them.</p>\n<p>The pseudo classes (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">:hover</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">:focus</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">:nth-of-type()</code> - plus 38 others) style elements in a <em>certain state</em>.</p>\n<p>The pseudo elements (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">::after</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">::before</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">::first-letter</code> - plus 3 others, not including experimental ones) apparently need <code class=\"language-text\">::</code> rather than <code class=\"language-text\">:</code>, although I've used them with only one. These don't depend on the state of an element.</p>\n<p>See this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements\">MDN</a> page for great examples and to use their awesome active learning playground (I did and it was great for learning)!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"01 July, 2018","path":"/explore/psuedo-selectors","title":"Psuedo Selectors"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
