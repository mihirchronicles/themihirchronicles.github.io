Some time ago, I started reading a lot which led to fiddling with lots of ideas. However, none of these ideas were concrete. I couldn't connect them to its origin and articulate them well. Writing became the next natural step of progression. The question I keep bumping into, ”how to write well?” Here is my attempt to answer that!</p>\n<h4>Why write?</h4>\n<p>Writing is an investigative tool to explore your thinking. Writing explores questions you are seeking answers to. Writing broadens your mind by turning abstraction (intuition and ideas) into concrete (words). You are full of fuzzy ideas that are strongly supported by your intuition. However, intuition isn't a tool. It is a gut feeling. It is a fuel that supports your biased decision making process. Turning intuition into tools means understanding their origin, limits and how they interact with other ideas. The tool available on hand is called writing. So why use such a tool? Turning ideas into words supported by logical thinking will crystallize your ideas. Writing allows us to think about ideas more rationally and deliberately question its origin and limitation. Writing allows you to remove distractions and biases. Writing can help you understand a topic clearly which then can help you narrate well. Writing extends memory and clarifies thinking. Writing is just another form of art. It requires deep and clear thinking.</p>\n<p>Writing helps you win! How? The person who can best formulate ideas can communicate the best argument. Writing preserves truth. It allows you to have profound and original ideas at your fingertip. Writing helps you sharpen your capacity to think, debate and present intelligently. Writing prevents you from falling prey to fads and ideologies.</p>\n<p>The most complex hierarchies such as law, medicine, business, politics or academics require clear thinking and communicating well. At this level of competency, you are required to defend your strategy in businss, economic policy in politics or defend your thesis in academia research. Thus, well formulated thoughts become necessary and valuable. Warren Buffett said it well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the things I think I think, I find don’t make any sense when I start trying to write them down. You ought to be able to explain why you’re taking the job you’re taking, why you’re making the investment you’re making, or whatever it may be. And if it can’t stand applying pencil to paper, you’d better think it through some more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, exposing writing to others will question your intent and thought process. There is no better way to get feedback. The more you share, the more feedback you'll receive creating a feedback loop.</p>\n<h4>Making writing less taxing</h4>\n<p>Writing takes cognitive load which can sometimes introduce writer's block. In order to prevent this negative sentiment, following certain rules can help us navigate the grey cloud. Writing can be less taxing if you go after incremental wins.</p>\n<p>First, use radically simple sentences and do not worry about grammatical syntax. The goal is to pen down whatever comes to your mind. Second, pretend you are writing a letter to someone explaining what you have learned. You should choose a person who you admire the most and pretend you are writing directly to them. This will bring forth your natural flow and tone. Third, do not worry about polishing your material just yet. Keep going! Fourth, do not worry about the length of your piece. You should make sure to gather all the facts and opinions. Fifth, use your experience and imagination to write. The latter is always great for story telling which captures the reader's attention. But if you get stuck, fall back on your experiences. Go back to a moment when you were star struck. Share those experiences if they are relevant to your topic.</p>\n<h4>Singular Purpose</h4>\n<p>You must define your purpose for writing. In this case, I want to become a better writer so I could think and articulate well. This purpose becomes the center of universe when exploring and writing around the topic. You should let go of sentences or ideas that has nothing to do with the topic. Vagueness causes confusion! To create a bond with a reader, you need to stay ultra-focused on your purpose. If you start to diverge from the original topic, it is time to rethink about the purpose. Lack of clarity will break the bond with your reader. For brevity, try to have one purpose for each sentence. But don't overkill on making your sentences so pure that they are boring or too dry to read. Narrative is as important as purpose to capture reader's attention. We'll address stylistic choices later for more fluid narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>Use ultra-focused titles to help you stay focused on your purpose.</strong> Titles are important. If anytime you feel diverged, titles can be a good reminder for your purpose. This only applies if you choose the right title. Using something like ”Society &#x26; Culture” can be dangerous because it does not allow a reader to understand the purpose of your writing. The title is so vague here. It is impossible to tell which society or which culture. A better title could be ”A brief history of American culture.” This will draw attention for users who are interested in American history. It is clear and concise.</p>\n<h4>Clarity</h4>\n<p>Sharpen your sentences. Each sentence should examine the truth. Revise your sentences over and over again until the sentence becomes readable and believable. Remember, brevity is the ultimate soul of wit. A good writing always conveys purpose with clarity. Clarity is an absolute must requirement.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"06 September, 2019","path":"/blog/how-to-write-well","title":"How To Write Well?"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"6 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
