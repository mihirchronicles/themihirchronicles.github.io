Some time ago, I started reading a lot which led to the fiddling with ideas. However, none of these ideas were concrete. I couldn't connect them to its origin and neither could I articulate them well. Writing became the next natural step of progression. The question I kept bumping into was, ”how to write well? Here is my attempt to answer that!</p>\n<h4>Why write?</h4>\n<p>Writing broadens your mind by turning abstraction (intuition and ideas) into concrete (words). You are full of fuzzy ideas that are strongly supported by your intuition. However, intuition isn't a tool. It is a gut feeling. Intuition is a fuel that supports your biased decision making process. Turning intuition into tools means understanding their origin, limitations and how they interact with other ideas.</p>\n<p>The tool available on hand is called writing.  Why use such a tool?</p>\n<p>Writing is an investigative tool to explore your thinking. Writing explores questions you are seeking answers to.</p>\n<p>Turning ideas into words supported by logical thinking will crystallize your ideas. Writing allows us to think about ideas more rationally and deliberately question its origin and limitations. Writing allows you to remove distractions and biases. Writing can help you understand a topic clearly which then can help you narrate well. Writing extends memory and clarifies thinking. Writing is just another form of art. It requires deep and clear thinking.</p>\n<p>Writing helps you win! How? The person who can best formulate ideas can communicate the best argument. Writing preserves truth. It allows you to have profound and original ideas at your fingertip. Writing helps you sharpen your capacity to think, debate and present intelligently. Writing prevents you from falling prey to fads and ideologies.</p>\n<p>The most complex hierarchies such as law, medicine, business, politics or academics require clear thinking and communicating well. At this level of competency, you are required to defend your strategy in business, economic policy in politics or defend your thesis in academia research. Thus, well formulated thoughts become necessary and valuable to persuade your audience. </p>\n<p>Warren Buffett once said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the things I think I think, I find don’t make any sense when I start trying to write them down. You ought to be able to explain why you’re taking the job you’re taking, why you’re making the investment you’re making, or whatever it may be. And if it can’t stand applying pencil to paper, you’d better think it through some more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, exposing writing to others will question your intent and thought process. There is no better way to get feedback. The more you share, the more feedback you'll receive creating a feedback loop.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes, the pen is mightier than the sword.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"06 September, 2019","path":"/blog/how-to-write-well","title":"How To Write Well?"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
