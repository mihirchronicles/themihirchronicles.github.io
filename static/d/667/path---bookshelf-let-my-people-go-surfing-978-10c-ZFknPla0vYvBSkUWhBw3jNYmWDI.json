{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h4>[I. Brief Summary]</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Yvon Chouniard was ahead of its times to challenge the conventional wisdom and responsibility of business. He argues against the model of capitalism which chases endless growth and the destruction of natural resources. Patagonia is in the business to make the best quality product, take care of planet, innovate on old rules of simplicity, and use business to drive behavioral change to prevent environmental crisis. The book uncovers Patagnoia's various business philosophies. Clothing business was born in late sixties, after a climbing trip in England. He began to see clothing as a way to help support the marginally profitable hardware business. Patagonia was named for the clothing business. Patagonia went through classic business challenges— inventory management, growing demand, quality control, vendor relationship, global logistics, financing operations, and many more. It almost brought Patagonia to bankruptcy. Yvon never thought himself of him as a businessman until now. He was a climber first. He had to take Patagonia seriously to make it sustinable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>[II. Big Ideas]</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>History: Chouinard was a young outdoor enthusiast. He did not appreciate how Europeans were rock climbing because they wee damaging the rock. So, he pursued to becoming a blacksmith and started making pitons to leave no trace when rock climbing. There was no competition for pitons. He surrounded himself with people who had similar interest of not damaging the nature and having a passion for outdoor life. These people also happended to be his customers. As the business grew, he expanded into other climbing tools. Each tool was constantly redesigned to be stronger, lighter, simpler and functional. Quality control was always taken seriously because if a tool failed, it could kill someone, and since they were their own best customers, there was a good change it could be one of them. The values of Patagonia have always been the same— there should be no difference between work and play. Providing on-site day care is a huge benefit provided to working parents. Parents can visit their kids anytime during the day. Patagonia has been innovating fabric since its early days while also trying to be environmental cautious. Patagonia has been donating and supporting grassroot organizations to fight against natural resource disruptors. This bottom-up approach has protected several natural resources. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away $79 million dollars protecting landmarks and human rights. Patagonia has kept up all these promises during boom or bust. This is only possible because the company is held private and not in the business of maximizing shareholder wealth, but rather in the busines of maximizing protection for natural resources. In 1991, country had entered recession and the business faced many challenges. Patagonia had laid people off simply to reduce overhead. Once Patagonia got its act together, it went anti-growth and created philosophies that it would operate on. Patagonia would let customers decide how much they should grow each year. It limtited company's growth at a sustainable rate so they would never have to lay off its employees again. Patagonia's story comes down to one mission statement: Make the best product, cause no necessary harm, and use businesss to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental causes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book breaks down its philosophies by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Design Philosophy:</li>\n<li>Production Philosophy: </li>\n<li>Distribution Philosophy:</li>\n<li>Marketing Philosophy: </li>\n<li>Financial Philosophy: </li>\n<li>Human Resource Philosophy: </li>\n<li>Management Philosophy:</li>\n<li>Environmental Philosophy: </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>[III. Quotes]</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>What if we shopped to live, instead of lived to shop?</li>\n<li>Studying Zen has taught me to simplify; to simplify yields a richer result. The rock climber becomes a master when he leave his big wall gear at the base, when he so perfects his skill that he climb the wall free, relying on his skill and the features of the rock.</li>\n<li>In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.</li>\n<li>One of my favorite sayings about entrepreneurship is: If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent. The delinquent is saying with his actions, “This sucks. I'm going to do my own thing.”</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"05 March, 2020","path":"/bookshelf/let-my-people-go-surfing","title":"Let My People Go Surfing Inc by Yvon Chouinard"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
