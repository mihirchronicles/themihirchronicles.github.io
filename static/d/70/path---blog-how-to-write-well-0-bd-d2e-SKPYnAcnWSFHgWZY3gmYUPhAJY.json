By the way, I am a victim of this hypothetical scenario and I constantly observe this happening around me.</p>\n<p>This is why I have made writing and sharing in public a priority.

As I write more, I want to make this piece about writing well, document my stylistic approach, common syntax errors so I can prose well.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use radically simple sentences.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"06 September, 2019","path":"/blog/how-to-write-well","title":"How To Write Well?"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
