{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">this</code> keyword is found in various programming languages, and behaves a certain way in JavaScript. Apparently even experienced developers get confused by it.</p>\n<p>See this <a href=\"https://codepen.io/ambrwlsn90/pen/ELEmxw?editors=1111\">codepen</a> for some example code. It showcases one of the six ways <code class=\"language-text\">this</code> is used in JavaScript - thanks to what I learned from Zell Liew's great <a href=\"https://zellwk.com/blog/this/\">blog post</a>. I really recommend this post for beginners - you can try the examples in your console! In short, <code class=\"language-text\">this</code> can be used globally, in object constructions, object methods, simple functions, arrow functions, and event listeners. See the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this\">MDN docs</a> for more code-heavy examples.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"01 July, 2018","path":"/explore/this","title":"This"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
