To master the art of product management requires many years of practice. The only way to learn it is to actually do it. Become a knowledge sponge, talk to external and internal product managers, read everything about the topic, copy others before you try to find your own voice and do something unique. Doing something unique is most probable after achieving mastery.</p>\n<h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>On a practical note, you are responsible for the following tasks on the team: running product review, maintaining/updating the product roadmap, and doing sprint planning. Here are two slides that help clarify your role vs the engineering manager.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Understand the customer deeply — this means user studies, you have to go talk to the users every week and spend a lot of time with them to hear their pain, get inside their head. product managers know the market, the product, the product line and the competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be metrics driven , you should be using time series data to give you insight into what people are doing with the product and see if the changes you are making are improving things. If you haven’t instrumented the app and chosen a metric you want to improve, you are just guessing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The product manager is responsible for prioritizing the product roadmap and communicating it to the team. Not as a top down dictator, but as a consensus builder amongst all the stakeholders, breaking a tie when necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You need to be a communication hub, both when building consensus internally on priorities/roadmap, but also externally communicating changes to customers. Users need to see that the product is continually improving by hearing about it from you. Everyone internally needs to be on the same page when changes roll out. You are the point of contact for all things related to this product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you master all of that, you will need to develop product vision (conviction about where things are going in the future, make the hard calls about what to eliminate, etc) and strive to make something truly great. You can think about it not just as eliminating customer pain, but actually creating customer delight. In rare instances, you can wind up creating something that people actually love. (very few products attain this — nobody says they love Tide detergent, but people do say they love their Harley Davidson).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good product managers don’t get all of their time sucked up by the various organizations that must work together to deliver right product right time. They don’t take all the product team minutes, they don’t project manage the various functions, they are not gophers for engineering. They are not part of the product team; they manage the product team. Engineering teams don’t consider Good Product Managers a “marketing resource.” Good product managers are the marketing counterpart of the engineering manager. Good product managers crisply define the target, the “what” (as opposed to the how) and manage the delivery of the “what.” Bad product managers feel best about themselves when they figure out “how”. Good product managers communicate crisply to engineering in writing as well as verbally. Good product managers don’t give direction informally. Good product managers gather information informally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good product managers create leveragable collateral, FAQs, presentations, white papers. Bad product managers complain that they spend all day answering questions for the sales force and are swamped. Good product managers anticipate the serious product flaws and build real solutions. Bad product managers put out fires all day. Good product managers take written positions on important issues (competitive silver bullets, tough architectural choices, tough product decisions, markets to attack or yield). Bad product managers voice their opinion verbally and lament that the “powers that be” won’t let it happen. Once bad product managers fail, they point out that they predicted they would fail.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Product Roadmap</h2>\n<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>\n<h2>Design Requirements</h2>\n<h2>Business Development</h2>\n<h2>People Management</h2>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/a-letter-to-a-new-product-manager-d5d96c228bf4\">A Letter To A New Product Manager by Brian Armstrong</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"04 March, 2020","path":"/blog/on-product-management","title":"On Product Management"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
