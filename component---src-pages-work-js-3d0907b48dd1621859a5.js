He is Warren Buffett's business partner at Berkshire Hathaway and famously known as one of the broadest thinkers. Munger coined the concept of mental models. Mental models are big ideas from big disciplines. When you collect models from lots of different fields, say psychology, literature, science, math, and so on— you will then be able to recognize lots of interesting connections. Models are reference points of understanding. Munger believes in collecting little packets of understanding for how things work, little models of the world. These mental models can help anyone ask the right questions by thinking critically. It is easy to pay homage to Charlie Munger’s latticework of mental models, but when you live it, you see why he is right. Knowing the key drivers and major ideas in a variety of fields is a huge source of leverage. It is difficult to study broadly and deeply, but the two aren't mutually exclusive.
