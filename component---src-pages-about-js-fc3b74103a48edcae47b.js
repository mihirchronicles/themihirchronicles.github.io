It takes years to build it and minutes to ruin it. If we don’t ask, we don’t get. If we don’t question, we don’t know. Authenticity and originality is born when we are honest to ourselves and others around us. Owning our actions can be incredibly difficult to do. We aren’t programmed to expose our egos or make ourselves vulnerable when we make mistakes or do something stupid. But one of the most powerful ways to make giant leaps forward in our lives is to not only accept that we’ll screw up, but to actively seek out correction when we do.

Positive, proactive behavior spurs positive and proactive behavior. The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity but an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.

Perseverance:")," stubbornness means being persistent. Don't give up or complain if something is not working out. Results are always on the opposite side of giving up. Being vulnerable is part of the process. In failing, there is humility. Accept any obstacles and overcome it. While obstacles persist, don't lose our cool. Be calm and solve problems rationally to overcome them. When in an unproductive state, start with a small win. Momentum in everyday life is highly underrated. It is all about effort. Reflect back when we fail to analyze symptoms from the disease. Enduring pain will help us take larger challenges and help us grow. If we have big goals, we will also fall hard but that is okay! It is part of the process. Struggling to get them will help us evolve. Courage (risk-taking) is the highest virtue. The journey of discovery is often tedious, filled with dead ends, and above all random but persistence through randomness will always prevail.
