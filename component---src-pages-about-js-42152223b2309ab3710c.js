Be calm and solve problems rationally to overcome them. When in an unproductive state, start with a small win. Momentum in everyday life is highly underrated. It is all about effort. Reflect back when we fail to analyze symptoms from the disease. Enduring pain will help us take larger challenges and help us grow. If we have big goals, we will also fall hard but that is okay!
