<h3>Who is a Product Manager?</h3>
<p>A person who is responsible to set overall capability vision and direction, own the quality and delivery of products, ensure roadmap is prioritized to address market opportunities, and lead the product management discipline for the team. <em>Product Owner</em> is a role you play on a scrum team. <em>Product Manager</em> is the job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good product takes chaos and creates order. — Brian Nogard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you set yourself up for success as a product manager? To master the art of product management requires many years of practice. The only way to learn it is to actually do it. Become a knowledge sponge, talk to external and internal product managers, read everything about the topic, copy others before you try to find your own voice and do something unique. Doing something unique is most probable after achieving mastery.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are most interested in the “creation” of a new scientific principle or a new application of an old one, but we can be general here. One way of investigating the problem is to consider the great ideas of the past and see just how they were generated. Unfortunately, the method of generation is never clear even to the “generators” themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
<p>On a practical note, you are responsible for the following tasks on the team: running product review, maintaining/updating the product roadmap, and doing sprint planning. Here are two slides that help clarify your role vs the engineering manager.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the customer deeply — this means user studies, you have to go talk to the users every week and spend a lot of time with them to hear their pain, get inside their head. product managers know the market, the product, the product line and the competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence. </li>
<li>Be metrics driven , you should be using time series data to give you insight into what people are doing with the product and see if the changes you are making are improving things. If you haven’t instrumented the app and chosen a metric you want to improve, you are just guessing.</li>
<li>The product manager is responsible for prioritizing the product roadmap and communicating it to the team. Not as a top down dictator, but as a consensus builder amongst all the stakeholders, breaking a tie when necessary.</li>
<li>You need to be a communication hub, both when building consensus internally on priorities/roadmap, but also externally communicating changes to customers. Users need to see that the product is continually improving by hearing about it from you. Everyone internally needs to be on the same page when changes roll out. You are the point of contact for all things related to this product.</li>
<li>Once you master all of that, you will need to develop product vision (conviction about where things are going in the future, make the hard calls about what to eliminate, etc) and strive to make something truly great. You can think about it not just as eliminating customer pain, but actually creating customer delight. In rare instances, you can wind up creating something that people actually love. (very few products attain this — nobody says they love Tide detergent, but people do say they love their Harley Davidson).</li>
<li>Good product managers don’t get all of their time sucked up by the various organizations that must work together to deliver right product right time. They don’t take all the product team minutes, they don’t project manage the various functions, they are not gophers for engineering. They are not part of the product team; they manage the product team. Engineering teams don’t consider Good Product Managers a “marketing resource.” Good product managers are the marketing counterpart of the engineering manager. Good product managers crisply define the target, the “what” (as opposed to the how) and manage the delivery of the “what.” Bad product managers feel best about themselves when they figure out “how”. Good product managers communicate crisply to engineering in writing as well as verbally. Good product managers don’t give direction informally. Good product managers gather information informally.</li>
<li>Good product managers create leveragable collateral, FAQs, presentations, white papers. Bad product managers complain that they spend all day answering questions for the sales force and are swamped. Good product managers anticipate the serious product flaws and build real solutions. Bad product managers put out fires all day. Good product managers take written positions on important issues (competitive silver bullets, tough architectural choices, tough product decisions, markets to attack or yield). Bad product managers voice their opinion verbally and lament that the “powers that be” won’t let it happen. Once bad product managers fail, they point out that they predicted they would fail.</li>
<li>Good product managers know the market, the product, the product line and the competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence. A good product manager is the CEO of the product. A good product manager takes full responsibility and measures themselves in terms of the success of the product. The are responsible for right product/right time and all that entails. A good product manager knows the context going in (the company, our revenue funding, competition, etc.), and they take responsibility for devising and executing a winning plan (no excuses).</li>
<li>Bad product managers have lots of excuses. Not enough funding, the engineering manager is an idiot, Microsoft has 10 times as many engineers working on it, I’m overworked, I don’t get enough direction. Barksdale doesn’t make these kinds of excuses and neither should the CEO of a product.</li>
<li>Good product managers focus the team on revenue and customers. Bad product managers focus team on how many features Microsoft is building. Good product managers define good products that can be executed with a strong effort. Bad product managers define good products that can’t be executed or let engineering build whatever they want (i.e. solve the hardest problem).</li>
<li>Good product managers think in terms of delivering superior value to the market place during inbound planning and achieving market share and revenue goals during outbound. Bad product managers get very confused about the differences amongst delivering value, matching competitive features, pricing, and ubiquity. Good product managers decompose problems. Bad product managers combine all problems into one.</li>
<li>Good product managers think about the story they want written by the press. Bad product managers think about covering every feature and being really technically accurate with the press. Good product managers ask the press questions. Bad product managers answer any press question. Good product managers assume press and analyst people are really smart. Bad product managers assume that press and analysts are dumb because they don’t understand the difference between “push” and “simulated push.”</li>
<li>Good product managers err on the side of clarity vs. explaining the obvious. Bad product managers never explain the obvious. Good product managers define their job and their success. Bad product managers constantly want to be told what to do.</li>
<li>Good product managers send their status reports in on time every week, because they are disciplined. Bad product managers forget to send in their status reports on time, because they don’t value discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p>At large technology companies like Google, product management can be a very stressful vocation. The truth is that you serve at the behest of your colleagues - you can't win without your team, and you certainly won't succeed without their backing. Given this, here's advice I share, and try to live by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product managers wear three hats
Congrats, as a product manager you get three jobs:
a) Project manager: keep the wheels on the bus, the trains running on time and over-communicating about status, documentation, strategy, vision, etc
b) Product manager: the actual feature and requirements spec'ing, working with your x-functional team to get things built and shipped
c) CEO: the buck stops with you no matter what the org chart says. When your product succeeds lavish praise on the team. If your product is struggling you don't blame sales or marketing - you help them get on track.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you're a greenhorn PM or a senior jedi master, you always wear these hats. It's just that your percentage of time allocated to each of the roles shifts away from A and towards C. Fresh out of school and you might be 35% project manager/60% product manager/5% CEO. It's important that the CEO # is never 0% -- even the newest PM hire should have something they approach this way. It builds accountability and a way of thinking that becomes essential to their development.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Seek collaboration, not necessarily consensus
In their leadership of flat x-functional teams some PMs seek consensus, thinking this is the best way to get a team moving in the same direction. I believe this is wrong. Collaboration, communication and inclusion are essential - you'll die on the vine without your team. But it's not consensus you should seek. It's a mandate to lead in a particular direction. The backing to make the call.</li>
</ol>
<p>You acquire your mandate power via upper mgmt supporting your strategic plan, from your x-functional team leads feeling included and empowered, and from your team members knowing that they can contribute and have ownership over their areas, but at the same time have a strong PM who will make the tough decisions.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Give PMs goals, not projects
Product managers turns goals into projects with the help of their teams and entrepreneurship. At YouTube we try to give our PMs broad ownership and then work with them to ensure the projects they initiate fulfill the needs and measurable goals of the area and the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overwhelm them as a prioritization exercise
Too much to do. That's the perpetual state of being a PM. But the benefit is you focus on the most meaningful actions and move from highest nail to highest nail. If you're leading a group of PMs the tricky thing is to make sure you're still positioning them for success. Gentle nudges, help in prioritizing, etc. But at the end of the day they need to develop this critical muscle where they learn to delegate and to pull resources towards them. The leveraged PM doesn't say "I can't get it done," they prioritize and help identify the resources necessary for success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Not on my watch"
Be willing to stand up for what you believe, especially when you're representing your users. Hard decisions make great products. Your job is not to carve the safe route. Your job is to increase the probability that you'll be delighting millions of users in a sustainable fashion. Don't let others design your product for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are a caretaker of something bigger
Your job is to take a product (and company) from one defined phase to the next. Then you will pass it on for another phase. The leader for the next phase might be you again or it could be someone else. Either way you should be handing off something which is sustainable. If your product was a winner solely because you carried the weight of the world on your shoulders then you're not doing your job. Build leverage, build an organization around you, find people who will be even better than you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some product management tips that you've come across?</p>
<ul>
<li>People don't want to use your software. They want to lose weight, laugh, be entertained, get smarter, spend time with loved ones, go home on time, sleep adequately, eat good food, be happy.
Your product is only as good as the experiences it enables people to have.</li>
<li>Person will set overall capability vision and direction, own the quality and delivery of software products, ensure roadmap is prioritized to address market opportunities, and lead the product management discipline for the team.</li>
<li>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job.</li>
<li>The more experience one has building things, the less they separate ideation and implementation.</li>
<li>Lemonis is famous for his People/Process/Product principle, where he analyzes businesses on the quality of people, excellence and relevance of product, and the best way to deliver the product.</li>
<li>Ultimately, the best thing you can do to prepare for a career in Product Management is to build. Manage and “own” a project from inception through execution and operation. Create KPIs and measure your impact. Volunteer for stretch projects. f you have a gap in client knowledge, shadow a CSC or Product Consultant. Learn about our clients, what jobs they are trying to accomplish with our products, and what problems Morningstar is uniquely positioned to solve for them. Become an expert in Morningstar’s products.</li>
<li>All things considered, the best way to validate your idea is to discuss it with everyone you can engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue. People who tend to keep their ideas to themselves or not able to communicate are normally not bound to success.</li>
<li>Questions are a product manager’s best tool. The best way to understand what’s going on or how to get better is to pose probing questions to the people you manage, and above all, to yourself. Pausing to infuse intention into every move at the outset, take a step back at key points along the way, or stop for a tune-up if you’re already further along the road is critical to leveling up as a leader — and questions are the keys that unlock the door to development.</li>
<li>Design shrinks the gap between what a product does and why it exists. Good design builds on earlier ideas, just as in math or physics. Good design is using reason to make decisions and to solve problems. Every man-made object you use in real life is designed, from forks and desks to keyboards and grocery bags and are the culminations of many hours of thinking and many more hours of trial and error.</li>
<li>A good product takes chaos and creates order. — Brian Nogard</li>
<li>'Customers don't have needs, they just want to make progress within the system they belong.' Eye-opening statement from Alan Klement's book. - Jérémie Pottier @dzey</li>
</ul>
<p>What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?
The top 10% of product managers excel at a few of these things. The top 1% excel at most or all of them:
Think big - A 1% PM's thinking won't be constrained by the resources available to them today or today's market environment. They'll describe large disruptive opportunities, and develop concrete plans for how to take advantage of them.
Communicate - A 1% PM can make a case that is impossible to refute or ignore. They'll use data appropriately, when available, but they'll also tap into other biases, beliefs, and triggers that can convince the powers that be to part with headcount, money, or other resources and then get out of the way.
Simplify - A 1% PM knows how to get 80% of the value out of any feature or project with 20% of the effort. They do so repeatedly, launching more and achieving compounding effects for the product or business.
Prioritize - A 1% PM knows how to sequence projects. They balance quick wins vs. platform investments appropriately. They balance offense and defense projects appropriately. Offense projects are ones that grow the business. Defense projects are ones that protect and remove drag on the business (operations, reducing technical debt, fixing bugs, etc.).
Forecast and measure - A 1% PM is able to forecast the approximate benefit of a project, and can do so efficiently by applying past experience and leveraging comparable benchmarks. They also measure benefit once projects are launched, and factor those learnings into their future prioritization and forecasts.
Execute - A 1% PM grinds it out. They do whatever is necessary to ship. They recognize no specific bounds to the scope of their role. As necessary, they recruit, they produce buttons, they do bizdev, they escalate, they tussle with internal counsel, they *.
Understand technical trade-offs - A 1% PM does not need to have a CS degree. They do need to be able to roughly understand the technical complexity of the features they put on the backlog, without any costing input from devs. They should partner with devs to make the right technical trade-offs (i.e. compromise).
Understand good design - A 1% PM doesn't have to be a designer, but they should appreciate great design and be able to distinguish it from good design. They should also be able to articulate the difference to their design counterparts, or at least articulate directions to pursue to go from good to great.
Write effective copy - A 1% PM should be able to write concise copy that gets the job done. They should understand that each additional word they write dilutes the value of the previous ones. They should spend time and energy trying to find the perfect words for key copy (button labels, nav, calls-to-action, etc.), not just words that will suffice.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I've ever met a 1% PM, certainly not one that I identified as such prior to hiring. Instead of trying to hire one, you're better off trying to hire a 10% PM who strives to develop and improve along these dimensions.
This is a very interesting question. Let’s first understand what distinguishes the top 1% from the top 10% in any field. Let’s also acknowledge that the top 10% in any field are likely to be some of the top notch performers in that field. The margin of difference is likely small. Yet there must be that extra special “it” factor that separates the top 1% from the rest. As a result, the top 1% enjoy a well-earned exalted status. That is why we speak of Michael Jordan, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and such people in a different breath from their peers in the game.</p>
<p>What is the special “it” factor?</p>
<p>A few things come to mind. Most of the points below apply to team sports, and since building and launching a product is a team sport, this analogy might just work.</p>
<p>Consistency
The top 1% athletes have been consistent performers at the top of their game for a very long period of time. Did they have bad days? Sure. Did they win all the time? Certainly not. The occasional failure notwithstanding these performers could be counted upon to deliver the goods a very high percentage of the time.</p>
<p>What does consistency mean for the 1% PM?</p>
<p>One might be tempted to say that if you delivered one hit product after another in one awesome company after another, that you would be a highly consistent 1% PM. Not really.</p>
<p>Consistency is about performance, not about the outcome. The outcome is dependent on a lot of other things. For the 1% PM, it is about consistently excellent decision making and behaviors that contributes to successful outcomes. The 1% PM earns the trust of the team and the executive leadership and can be counted upon to take solid judgements and actions over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Consistently solid decisions, for instance, about strategic direction, roadmap prioritization and tradeoffs, investment cases, etc. The quality of such decisions is reflected in revenue, usage and market share growth.</p>
<p>Consistent behaviors that form the basis of those solid decisions, for instance, staying intimately connected with customers, users and the market at large, meeting deadlines and expectations for deliverables, always keeping a strategic perspective and clarity about what success means, communicating effectively and frequently, building strong relationships with all stakeholders, staying up to date with the technology stack and trends, to name a few.</p>
<p>Consistent decision making and behavior is critical to the 1% PM building credibility and trust within her organization.</p>
<p>Leadership
In a team sport like basketball, the top 1% players on the team emerge as the de-facto leaders. The team looks up to them. They lead by example. They provide the mentoring and coaching to the junior members of the team. They want everyone in the team to be successful. They do not let their egos come in the way of the goals of the team. If the team wins, they celebrate the team effort. If the team loses, the buck stops with them.</p>
<p>Phil Jackson writes about Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in his book “Eleven Rings: The Soul of Success” :</p>
<p>"One of the biggest differences between the two stars from my perspective was Michael's superior skills as a leader," Jackson said. "Though at times he could be hard on his teammates, Michael was masterful at controlling the emotional climate of the team with the power of his presence. Kobe had a long way to go before he could make that claim.”</p>
<p>The 1% PM is looked upon as a leader in the organization. Some of the behaviors mentioned above contribute to this. In addition, the 1% PM has a very strong understanding of her product, technology and the financials. She is intimately familiar with the KPIs and metrics of success. As a result, she can represent the product team effectively in executive discussions. She has a seat at the table and frequently leads the conversations when important decisions about the product line are made.</p>
<p>She communicates effectively across the team, but also with individuals, akin to shaking hands and kissing babies on the campaign trail, as they say. She does this genuinely and does not fake it. She negotiates, cajoles, resolves conflicts, and builds relationships, while ensuring everyone knows what ultimate success really means. The 1% PM demonstrates servant leadership because she knows that she will be successful when everyone around her is successful. Personal glory and decoration is less important to her for it’s own sake.</p>
<p>Confidence
The top 1% players have supreme confidence in their ability to deliver and perform at the highest level, regardless of the high pressure stakes. When the team is down by 3 points with just a few seconds left on the clock, they want the ball in their hands. It does not mean they will win every game from that situation, but when the chips are down, they want to step up to the plate, soak the pressure and lead by action.</p>
<p>The 1% PM exudes similar confidence. She is confident of holding her own in deep technical discussions with architects. She is confident of standing in front of a room of executives and articulating the product strategy, or making an investment case to help drive the strategy. When she visits upset and irate customers, she assures them confidently that the team has a plan in place to move the needle in the right direction. She knows she won’t be right all the time and doesn’t have to be. So her confidence is not one of arrogance. Rather, it comes from having the passion to make a difference to customers and to the organization.</p>
<p>Confidence of the 1% PM comes from having a strong work ethic. Success is not guaranteed, but confidence eliminates fear of failure.</p>
<p>All-Rounder
When the game is over, we realize that the top 1% of the players made their impact felt in all aspects of the game - offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, assists, high free throw shooting percentage, 3-point shots, steals, etc. They are all over the court, in fact they try and own the court.</p>
<p>The 1% PM is also an all-rounder. In startups, in addition to being the product manager, if needed she can hack together some demo code, she goes on sales calls as the sales engineer and installs the product, she writes the datasheet and the whitepaper, and she holds the attention of 300 people on a webinar.</p>
<p>In large companies, there are dedicated people in various functional roles. However, the 1% PM very much plays up and down the court. She meets regularly with sales engineers to understand insights from the field. She listens in on support calls. She works with marketing to understand the performance of lead generation campaigns and sales funnel analysis. She positions the value proposition and unique differentiators which form the basis of marketing messaging. She presents her product strategy and roadmap to industry analysts. She works with sales and channel teams to enable them to position and sell the product.</p>
<p>The 1% PM plays an important role across the entire product lifecycle, way before the first line of code is written, all the way to launch, driving awareness and sales, and supporting customers.</p>
<p>We may be tempted to say that this is fundamental for any product manager, but so many product managers are not able to cover the court, either due to lack of time, or due to lack of skills. The 1% PM knows how and where to spend her time and energy most effectively.</p>
<p>Work Ethic
The top 1% players have a strong work ethic. They don't shirk. They practice hard. They don't rest on their laurels, and they don't rely on their natural talents. They don't wing it. They are perfectionists. They work on all aspects of their game.</p>
<p>The top 1% PM also has a strong work ethic attention to detail. She does not make compromises. She puts in the necessary amount of practice before important presentations. She stays late with the team when needed. She gives equal attention to staff engineers and executives. She is always looking for learning opportunities and seeks mentors inside and outside the organization.</p>
<p>Alignment of Vision
The 1% athlete is not self made. Even Michael Jordan has a coach, and he is aligned with the coach's vision for the team.</p>
<p>The 1% PM is similarly aligned with the company vision. Her product strategy is aligned with the strategic direction and initiatives of the company. She leverages and extends the core competencies of the organization. She takes the effort to communicate and ensure understanding of the vision and strategy by everyone in the team.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>The best way to get ahead of this is asking the right questions. I was lucky to find a great opportunity at my current company that had lots of processes in place for an incoming Product Manager but, in hindsight, have learned so much I wouldn’t have even thought to ask during my interview or in my first few months learning the role. In a role where so much is out of your control, having the answers to some of these questions can often be the bare minimum to meet a standard of competence.

<p>Product managers are the glue that bind the many functions that touch a product—engineering, design, customer success, sales, marketing, operations, finance, legal, and more. They not only own the decisions about what gets built but also influence every aspect of how it gets built and launched.</p>

<p>Before becoming the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Marissa Mayer were product managers, and they learned how to influence and lead teams by shepherding products from planning to development to launch and beyond. Such experience is also valuable beyond tech: PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi started her career in product management–like roles at Johnson &#x26; Johnson and Mettur Beardsell, a textile firm.</p>
<p>While today such a background remains rare among CEOs, product-management rotational programs are the new leadership-development programs for many technology companies (for example, see the Facebook Rotational Product Manager Program, the Google Associate Product Manager Program, and the Dropbox Rotation Program). Any critic of the analogy between product managers and CEOs will point out that product managers lack direct profit-and-loss responsibilities and armies of direct reports, so it is critical for product managers with ambitions for the C-suite to move into general management to broaden their experience.</p>
<p>An intense focus on the customer is prominent among all product managers. For example, product managers at Amazon are tasked with writing press releases from the customer’s perspective to crystalize what they believe customers will think about a product, even before the product is developed.2 This press release then serves as the approval mechanism for the product itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgolden/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgolden/</a> If Golden could share just one organizing principle, it would be this: Design your product teams around outcomes, not features. “A lot of people call me and ask how they should structure their product organizations. I always tell them to do it based on outcome. If you do it based on features, then you’re going to be perpetuating those features whether they’re useful or not.” Your company vision is what you want the world to look like in five-plus years — outcomes are the team mandates that will help you get there. “Outcomes define what we want to achieve for people in our community,” says Golden. (More context on this later.) Golden advises founders to focus initially on the things that are working and grow into their product vision organically. “I’ve seen company scope expand too quickly,” he says. “Normally if something is working and you double down on that, then whatever you are measuring will dramatically accelerate. If something is only half working and you need to go do something else to achieve your goal, then maybe it really wasn’t working as well as you had thought.” Airbnb optimizes for agility first and foremost by assembling interdisciplinary product teams. The notion of a group of product managers sitting together in a bullpen apart from the rest of the organization is anathema. Instead, product managers are matched with engineers, designers, and data scientists to attack business problems from all sides. This modular team structure is how Airbnb has managed to keep the spirit of an early-stage startup as it’s grown into a tech giant. “In the early days, we used to have one big meeting, with all of engineering, all of design, all of data science, and all of product management in one room. Of course, at the time that was maybe 20 people,” says Golden. “We’ve evolved from there, but we kept the core of how the team operated.” There’s no feeling of rank within each team and no room for prima donnas. “Everybody has the same ownership of impact across data, design, engineering, and product. ” If a team needs to communicate something to the rest of the company, it selects the appropriate lead — a data scientist, for example, would communicate the results of a major A/B experiment. “It’s a team that operates cohesively, versus one person who’s potentially more of a totalitarian leader.” Hire These 3 Types of PMs — You’ll Need Them All. Pioneers These are people who are excited by building prototypes, who are pumped about the riskiness of the endeavor and when creating something brand new in the world,” says Golden. Sound a lot like a founder? That’s not a coincidence; founders are typically their companies’ first product person — the ultimate pioneer. But whether you bring it to the table yourself or hire for it, this is the type of PM energy a company needs at the start. How to spot them: These risk-taking front-liners need to be scrappy, so look for someone who has entrepreneurial experience already. That might be someone who was CEO of his or her own company, or even a PM who led an exploratory team for a large company (the lead for a new product area at Google, for example). Don’t, however, assume that any startup experience equals pioneer experience. “There is a huge difference between somebody who has built something and somebody who has maintained something,” says Golden.</p>
<p>What is your process for uncovering user needs?</p>
<p>How do you know if you’ve achieved product market fit?</p>
<p>Tell me a time when you did something non-scalable to jumpstart a product.</p>
<p>I’m thinking about building “X” — what do you do to get it built in 10 days?</p>
<p>Town Planners</p>
<p>These are your platform managers, who take over when it’s time to build the infrastructure and systems necessary to handle scale and accommodate your product’s use cases, current and future.</p>
<p>Good town planners are also entrepreneurs. Many town planners have technical backgrounds but that is not a hard requirement. They can also work with technical visionaries where the product manager can steer the vision to realize its practicality for the broader product team. At Airbnb, they added product management support to the core infrastructure teams to help them build technical tools to set the business up for scale through the next few years.</p>
<p>How to spot them: “Town planners must be able to synthesize large amounts of disparate information to build technology that will service existing and unanticipated use cases,” says Golden. Don’t just look for workhorses who can lay down a solid backend foundation—these PMs also need a vision for the future product initiatives that foundation could support.</p>
<p>Here’s what to ask to figure out if someone has the capacity to be a town planner:</p>
<p>What metric would you measure to determine success for a platform product?</p>
<p>Tell me about a time when you built a system that supported a variety of use cases.</p>
<p>How do you balance building toward known cases versus unknown future use cases?</p>
<p>How do you know if the platform is too rigid or too flexible?</p>
<p>A brand-new enterprise needs to know when to bring on the next wave of product management. But even in an established company, all three types of product managers are critical. “The product team needs each of these PMs to be nimble and responsive. Otherwise the business won’t endure for the long term,” says Golden. “We allocate product resources across three main categories: core initiatives that focus on the existing product, new initiatives that explore possible areas of growth for the business, and platform initiatives that focus on building fundamental technological infrastructure.” Pioneers and settlers don’t become obsolete just because you’re at scale.</p>
<p>And town building isn’t the end of the road — it’s just the groundwork for a new round of pioneering. Golden’s Payments team, for example, is primarily tasked with building a platform. But since the exchange of funds touches everything the company does, his team also contributes to many of Airbnb’s new guest and host conversations. “We’re always thinking, ‘Okay, how do we take the system that we’ve built, which is moving a lot of money around the world right now, to think about where the business is going?’”</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/marquee-test-akiaisur2rgicbmpehea/s002QKmnR96eIEdHMv0I_process.jpg">https://s3.amazonaws.com/marquee-test-akiaisur2rgicbmpehea/s002QKmnR96eIEdHMv0I_process.jpg</a></p>
<p>By the time you reach the bottom of this flowchart, resourcing decisions may not be easy, but they’ll be clearer.</p>
<p>“Everybody always wants more resources,” says Golden. “For the most part, nobody is saying ‘I’m fine, I don’t need to grow.’ People feel like their work can be contributing to the product, to the community, and in a high-growth company that’s usually true.” Product managers, then, need to work with founders and other company leaders to establish priorities.</p>
<p>It’s very much a PM’s role to decide which bets to place.</p>
<p>Every quarter, he conducts a review of each of his teams to determine the impact they’re having on the business and whether they’re hitting their goals. “We say, ‘Okay, if this team is established and we’ve articulated all our goals and we didn’t hit one — or for some reason something is off — why are we off? What happened?’” Once again, he starts at the top of the chart. “The first question is ‘Did this product or project actually fit into the product vision?’ Usually it does, but other times we’ve had to be uncomfortably honest.”</p>
<p>It’s clear why a company might want to whip up a product team from scratch, but what about the how?
When a product manager is engaged with a given team, how do you sell her on dropping everything to tackle a new challenge? If you’ve established a vision-based company culture, this is where you’ll really reap the rewards. Teams will be bought in to accomplishing a goal, not bringing a particular feature or product to market. “If you’ve done it right from the get-go—articulated your vision, outcome and goals right — it should be much easier to have a conversation about reallocating human resources,” says Golden.</p>
<p>Decommissioning a team is often the harder side of this equation, but there too, let your product vision serve as a touchstone. Take the team through your goal-setting framework and identify where things went wrong or changed. Was it a flaw in the product vision, strategy, goal, metrics, or resourcing? “If you go through that process, then the team gets much more comfortable with the reason things didn’t work out as well as they thought,” says Golden. Moreover, in an iterative product management culture, individuals have less to fear.</p>
<p>You can’t achieve a real culture of iteration without accepting failure. “The key to postmortems is obviously to not point fingers. It’s all about lessons learned and identifying why things happened the way they did.”</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2013, Golden managed a team that focused on user tools. They handled all guest and host interactions after the booking and tackled many issues around reservation alterations, refunds, and cancellations. But they didn’t have a clear mission that related to an outcome.</p>
<p>“We realized that it would be best to disperse the team into two outcome oriented teams — the booking flow team and the host team,” he says. “This enabled these two teams to realize their mandate through a wider but yet overall more simplistic scope.”</p>
<p>To that end, he hews closely to three simple pillars: process, context, and listening.</p>
<p>Process: Having a clear framework for making company decisions, as we’ve seen, is key. Transparently discussing the results of that process is, too.</p>
<p>Context: A clear vision isn’t enough, though. You need to make sure everyone on the team sees that vision too. Don’t be afraid to repeat yourself. In fact, be sure to repeat yourself. “You have to communicate it all the time,” says Golden. “And as new people join the team, tell them the history of how things evolved. That context is usually really helpful.”</p>
<p>Listening: As a team leader, Golden is also acutely aware that his communication responsibilities go both ways; just as he repeatedly shares the company’s vision with his team, he also contributes his teams’ feedback to leadership’s ongoing vision making. “You’re not going to be able to make the best decisions without actually talking to individual people and making sure that you’re addressing their concerns.”</p>
<p>“It’s the job of a team lead — whether in product, engineering, design, or data — to communicate the what and the why. But if people don’t agree, then you have to revisit them. Anybody can push back. Challenging core fundamental assumptions is really healthy.”</p>
<p>Beyond these three tenets of communication, Golden is not one to dictate how often teams should meet with each other, or how they manage their internal messaging. “We allow each team to figure out their own cadence, their own process and structure. We like to see each team have it’s own character—a little bit of identity.”</p>
<p>“Again, much of the work of product management is making sure everybody understands the what and the why," he says. "Leaving it up to teams to figure out how to actually make that happen empowers them to do better and find more meaning in their work. I think everyone wants a say in their daily work — that’s not just in tech land, that’s in life.”</p>
<p>The Jobs to be Done Interviewing Style: Who are our Users Trying to Become?
How this popular framework can guide your user interviews.</p>
<p>At first, I resisted Jobs to be Done.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand how to use it. I didn’t see what it added over traditional generative interviews.  It had a lot of buzz, and it was totally out of my comfort zone. </p>
<p>Fortunately, not too long ago, I was reintroduced to the concept and have grown to be more open-minded about different user research methodologies. And it didn’t take me long to balk at my own unwillingness to learn something new. I picked up two books: Jobs To Be Done by Tony Ulwick and Competing Against Luck by Clayton Christensen. In the weekend it took me to devour them, I was not only a convert, but also as excited as a kid in a candy shop. The methodology offered us something special, and I couldn’t wait to put this into practice. </p>
<p>Psssst. We sat down with Jobs to be Done (JTBD) creator, Tony Ulwick, to discuss the intersection of qual research and the methodology. Watch it for free here. </p>
<p>Understand: What is Jobs to be Done?
Surprisingly, this is a controversial question. Since JTBD was loosely written about as a theory, there are many different views on what Jobs To Be Done is and how it should be interpreted. </p>
<p>Some people view Jobs To Be Done as a well-branded repackaging of concepts already known to the research community, like task analysis. Others, however, believe it’s a totally new, innovative approach for how to think about your users and their decision-making process. </p>
<p>To keep it simple, I will stay away from controversy. Instead, I’ll cover the basics and explain how you can let JTBD guide your user interviews.</p>
<p>Jobs To Be Done encompasses the concept that users are trying to get something done, and that they “hire” certain products or services in order to make progress towards accomplishing goals. Usually, we all want to be better than we are in a given moment. We all have goals that lead us closer to our ideal self. So, we will look for, and purchase, certain products or services when our current reality does not match what we want for the future. In addition, we will also switch to a new product or service when our current solution is no longer sufficiently getting us towards our goals. </p>
<p>Mainly, I use Jobs to be Done to answer the following questions about users:</p>
<p>Why did a user start looking for a particular product/service? What was the trigger?
Why did a user hire (purchase) a product/service for the first time?
Why and how did a user switch between two (or more) different products/services?
How did a user search for new products/services?
When you boil it down, we, as researchers, are simply trying to understand the hiring/purchasing patterns of our users, and what conditions have to exist for a user to start using product X, and why they would then switch from product X to product Y.</p>
<p>Implement: Framing interviews with Jobs to be Done
Structurally, getting started with Jobs to be Done is relatively similar to how you would begin a classic generative research session. I usually slot 60-90 minutes for the interview time, as sometimes it can take a while to get comfortable, especially if you are new to this interviewing technique. I recruit a bit differently, however. I usually screen for: </p>
<p>People who just recently started using our product/service
People who have just recently stopped using our product/service
People who have not yet used our product/service
With these groups of people I hope to understand:</p>
<p>Why people switch to our product/service
Why people switch away from our product/service
What people who have not heard about our product/service are trying to accomplish and how they are currently doing that
What pushes/pulls people into using our (or a competitor’s) product/service
As you can see, switching behavior is extremely important, as is the concept of being pushed or pulled into a product/service. A lot of these interviews are focused on why people are switching from one product/service to the next, and what happened to make them say: “Hey, I need a better solution.” </p>
<p>And this is where Jobs To Be Done gets hard. You can’t simply ask a user why she switched to a different product/service. If you do, you won’t get to that deeper goal that is actually driving this behavior. I’ll use myself as an example.  </p>
<p>I just recently switch all of my cleaning products to be vegan. And this was a huge pain to do. First, I live in Germany, and my level of understanding the German language is not at the point where I can distinguish exactly what product ingredients mean—and online translation often comes up with some ridiculous suggestions. Second, it is a lot of money to switch from the store-branded name to vegan products. Third, it takes a lot of research and time to find vegan cleaning products that actually work. </p>
<p>And if you ask me why I decided to do this, I would tell you: I want to contribute to helping the environment. While that’s true, it’s a surface-level answer.</p>
<p>If you dig deeper, you’d realize I deeply care about animals. And my decision-making process actually took place over several years. I’d realized I not only wanted to be more environmentally and animal-friendly, but I also wanted to be seen as more conscious and aware of my impact on the world. I was embarrassed at how much of a conflict I had between loving animals and using or eating animal-based products. And I was finally pushed to the decision because I was sick of my cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>But if you asked me about it point blank: that’s probably not what I’d tell you. </p>
<p>In order to understand deeper goals and behavior, we need to entice users into telling us stories surrounding why they are deciding to do something. Similar to generative research, we need to probe, but we need to do so in a specific way. My interview scripts have always been relatively bare-boned, as I usually have several high-level questions I want to ask, and I let the interviewee then lead the direction of the conversation. I try to focus on the “switch event” that leads a participant to make a change. These are the main questions I always include:</p>
<p>What other solutions did you consider before trying the product /service?
What were you trying to find when you were considering those solutions?
What were you trying to solve?
Tell me about how you looked for these products/services.
What other solutions have you actually used?
What did and didn’t you like about other solutions you’ve tried/used?
If this product/service wasn’t available to you, what you do instead?
What solutions have the people you know tried or used?
What are you doing now compared to the past?
Since most of our memories are recalled through associations with people, places, smells or sounds, I often ask users what time of day it was, if they were at home or at work, if the TV was on in the background, and who they were. This helps get them into the mindset to tell stories that bring up feelings associated with the experiences. </p>
<p>Once I understand the different competitors, and potentially grasp the switching behavior, I start trying to dig deeper with more emotionally questions like: </p>
<p>When did you first realize you needed something to solve your problem?
Did you talk to anyone else about what choices you were considering? What was this conversation like?
Was anything recommended to you?
What did you imagine using this product/service would be like?
What did you want from the product/service?
Did you have any anxiety about purchasing/using this product/service?
Was there anything that made you nervous about using it?
While conducting the interview, listen for motivations or pain points that led to a switch:</p>
<p>Push of the situation: what was it about their particular situation that led them to look for a new solution?
Pull of the situation: what was it about the new solution that made them want to try it?
Habits holding them back: what habits do they have that may prevent them from trying a new solution?
Anxieties of the new solution: what anxieties did they have about trying or using a new solution?
This takes a lot of practice, so I do recommend trying these techniques internally with your company or with friends before venturing out to the world of your users.</p>
<p>Jobs To Be Done suggests that users want to make a positive change in their lives, and the way they do that is through progress. If we, as researchers, focus on what the positive change is, and how to help users make that change, we can easily get users towards their desired goal.</p>

Act: Why is Jobs to be Done worth doing?
For me, Jobs To Be Done has brought a whole new perspective to user research, and unearthed different ways I can help companies succeed. As anything, it isn’t a magic potion. In fact, it’s a descriptive theory. It does not prescribe a certain way of doing things, and it is not explicit in what you should do to change. </p>
<p>Mastering this technique is tricky and takes a lot of practice. Oftentimes, people don’t actually understand why they did something and are not able to analyze themselves in an unbiased way. </p>
<p>Jobs To Be Done suggests that users want to make a positive change in their lives, and the way they do that is through progress. If we, as researchers, focus on what the positive change is, and how to help users make that change, we can easily get them users towards their desired goal in a much more efficient and enjoyable way. With this information, we can build powerful products with useful features that speak directly to our users. We can help transform our users into their ideal selves. </p>

When I joined Twitter, one of my key responsibilities was building the product management organization to keep pace with the growth of our engineering and design teams and to lay the foundation for scalable product development going forward.  In less than a year, we more than tripled the size of the team (total company headcount grew even faster).  As you might expect with that kind of employee growth, there were many questions about how various functions should work together, especially the product development-oriented functions of engineering, design and product management.  At Twitter, we evangelized an operating model where project teams were constructed with product, engineering and design leads, each representing three equal legs of the product development stool (with other functions also providing input and feedback throughout the development process).  However, as the teams began working under this model, it became clear that each function was struggling with defining its role relative to the roles of other functions.  Who should be involved in what conversations?  Where were the lines drawn?  Who was the “decider”?  And like many companies, we were faced with the oft-asked existential questions of “Is product management needed?” and “What role does product management play in product development?”</p>
<p>Given all of these questions, my product team needed a reminder about why they were all there as individuals and as a product management function.  Fortunately, the web offers many excellent write-ups and conversations about what it means to be a great product manager.  But I also wanted to share my personal views on product management, developed through years of product success and failure, particularly because I believe that product management is more an attitude than a set of skills.</p>
<p>Below is the description of the product manager’s mentality that I shared with the team at Twitter.  I was told that it proved helpful to many of them (hopefully it still is!) as they worked with their engineering and design peers and I’m hopeful that it will be equally useful to product people (current and aspiring) who are trying to do the difficult but incredibly gratifying job of product management.  In one way or another, it’s a job I’ll always have and love.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>As Product Managers, we are the CEOs of our products.  We love products.  We focus first on delivering value to our users.  We know who we are building for and what we are building.  We know why we are building it and where we are building to long term.  We communicate the who, what, why and where clearly, concisely and frequently.  We communicate with anyone and everyone who is interested, but most importantly to our teams.  We let our teams determine how to build.</p>
<p>We pursue excellence by thinking bigger and bolder than is comfortable.  We don’t settle for good enough.  We choose right over easy.  We choose simplicity over complexity.  We don’t make excuses.  We take responsibility.  We are tirelessly curious.  We respect our competitors, not fear them.  We understand why we win and what we must do to keep winning.</p>
<p>We lead by example.  We succeed by making others successful.  We listen first and make certain that others feel that they’ve been heard.  We pursue diverse opinions.  We rally our teams behind a vision that yields passion and commitment.  We value and foster strong team relationships.</p>
<p>We are determined and positive.  We use words and take actions that embody a can-do attitude.  We trust others to do their jobs well but we verify that they are done right.  We are honest, direct and empathetic.  We adjust to our audiences and situations.  We are decisive when needed, but always collaborative.</p>
<p>We know the definition of success.  We hold ourselves and our teams accountable to it.  We set the bar high.  We provide focus through prioritization.  We increase quality through iteration.  We don’t like surprises, so we prepare for them.  We pay attention to the details because we care.  We fill in the gaps and do whatever it takes to get the job done.  We don’t wait to be told what to do.  We leverage data but aren’t slaves to it.  We are honest.  We seek the truth.</p>
<p>We take time to reflect.  We don’t fear failure.  We strive to improve.</p>
<p>We are Product Managers.</p>
<p>Engineering to Product - Learnings and Observations
This essay is a recap of 3 years of product management experience (After 10 years of being software developer). I worked on projects that had direct business impact - fun, stressful, and intense experience. No regrets 😉</p>
<p>I sorted my observations and learnings by their subjective importance.</p>
<p>People manager first
I started to realize this is important when I was at least one year into product management. If you’re running a team, maintaining team health is an essential part of your job.</p>
<p>In theory, you’ll have an engineering manager who is responsible for that, but in reality, you should be laser focused on it yourself. At the end - even if you have an excellent backlog, full of brilliant ideas - if the team is not feeling well or you don’t have team trust - you won’t be able to execute, and everything will inevitably fall apart.</p>
<p>Do 1-1s with engineers and designers. Make sure that they are happy and motivated. Build trust.</p>
<p>Invest in yourself and learn a few bits about psychology, building relationships with people, and engineering management.</p>
<p>You are in charge
You’re responsible for project outcomes. Listen to your team, your boss, boss of your boss, friends, family, that random person from a coffee shop - be informed and process information, but never forget that you are in charge and you are making decisions.</p>
<p>Be bold, make decisions yourself, and be prepared to carry responsibility.</p>
<p>Democracy and business do not blend.</p>
<p>Conserve energy (part 1 - you)
Management is a 24/7 job. Even if you show up in the office for a few hours, you’ll inevitably think about the project 24/7. It’s exhausting and exhausted people aren’t good at making decisions.</p>
<p>Consider your job a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t work in the evenings. Don’t work on the weekends. Re-charge. Take vacations often. Fully disconnect during vacations/weekends/time off.</p>
<p>Conserve energy (part 2 - team, a.k.a. it’s ok to be idle)
This thing applies both to you and your team - it’s ok to be idle. Make sure that team understands that and comfortable with that. If you don’t know what to work on - let the team know. Do not try to keep the team busy. Let people work on whatever they want to work on, take time to learn something new, refactor that annoying piece of tech debt from the past or just rest and re-charge.</p>
<p>Do not work on low priority stuff or 10-year-old bugs to fill the time - in the long run, it’s counterproductive and lowers team morale.</p>
<p>And never say no to vacation requests. Even if they are coming at the worst time. Think long term.</p>
<p>Stay on the maker schedule*
Avoid meetings congestion - skip meetings if you don’t see the value. Find a polite way to skip and avoid meetings that don’t bring value to you or your team. Provide feedback to meeting owners.</p>
<p>1-1s are for everything. 1-1s are the most important and productive meetings. Take as much value from them as you can. Prepare the agenda in advance. Never skip them (it can send the wrong message). Have them scheduled for the same time always. Make them a habit. (I usually schedule them close to each other and block 2-4 hours every week for them)</p>
<p>Write > Talk. Unless it’s bad news or something that could be interpreted wrong (because it will always be).</p>
<p>Delegate everything (and grow your team)
It is part of - people manager first thing - grow your team, let team members be in charge. Create safety nets, let people make mistakes and be wrong.</p>
<p>A few techniques that worked for me:</p>
<p>One of the team members is a scrum master. This role is not only an accountant or meeting moderator. The scrum master should be able to answer questions during standups and be your ambassador. Invest time in training. Rotate every quarter/year.
When you’re off by any reason (vacation, sick, etc.) ask one of the team members to assume product owner role instead of you. They should drop engineering/design and pretend that it’s a full-time job. Let this person plan, change backlog, attend all meetings instead of you and be in charge. (Safety net - if you’ll drive in a wrong direction we’ll fix it)
Team members do demos - let people show off their work in front of the audience. Stakeholders must be present at this meeting. Invest time into training and making sure that people understand what’s the purpose of the demo and how to do it.
Always ask for input on backlog or roadmap during 1-1s. I don’t see much value in doing it during group meetings because people tend to be more closed and less sincere. 1-1 is a perfect time. If you do it every week, it gets into the habit, and people inevitably think about it before 1-1s.
Always be in the planning mode
Do not put it off for an official “planning meeting” or “backlog grooming.” Planning is a vital part of your job - groom and review your backlog every day - if something changed or you learned something new - adjust immediately.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you’ll recover time by combining staying in planning mode and discussing product future with the team during 1-1s. You’ll be able to drop “official” plannings. These meetings tend to be long and exhausting. Many times they end up in a format where 2 persons argue about a small thing and the rest of the team just listening and thinking about what they could do better with their time.</p>
<p>Data
Data informs everything. Do it yourself (or delegate within your team). Learn SQL and Statistics 101. Do not depend on other teams. Data is your job.</p>
<p>Start every project with data infrastructure. If you can’t measure improvement - there is no improvement.</p>
<p>I always set aside 5-10 minutes between demo and retrospective to do data demo for stakeholders. Walk through metrics and tell what we are going to do next sprint to drive team metrics. I find that it forces me to dig deeper into the data and avoid working on things that do not drive metrics.</p>
<p>Pursue the big thing
Distractions creep into the backlog. Review and purge often. Skip bugs unless they are that bad. Bugs tend to eat 90% of the time in return of 10% improvement.</p>
<p>Focus on one metric and drop anything that doesn’t affect it.</p>
<p>Get thing out of the door ASAP
Make it run, make it right, make it fast transfers perfectly to product management.</p>
<p>Release the product as soon as it looks like something usable, and then iterate on the live product. Perfection is the enemy of good.</p>
<p>Constant cadence of iteration helps a lot with meeting deadlines (and predicting misses).</p>
<p>The Process
Pick your processes and stick to it.</p>
<p>Adjust by doing retrospectives and carefully listening during 1-1s.</p>
<p>Long meetings are the worst - avoid them at all cost. Always moderate. Ask people to follow-up 1-1. If there is a meeting that needs more than 30 minutes - refactor it by splitting, canceling, changing participants.</p>
<p>Cross team communication (a.k.a The Politics)
Politics and cross-team dynamics are very fluid and company depending.</p>
<p>A few things I learned:</p>
<p>“No” is the default answer. (But never say “no” be a polite and diplomatic person). People around are asking for random things that are important to them around your area of ownership. Use it as an input and consider it but do not jump into it or you are risking saturating your backlog with random things and impeding work on The Big Thing.
Ask for help or advice very carefully. You’re sharing responsibility when asking for help. People will (unconsciously) expect you to follow their advice and become sad if you don't. If you are not going to follow their advice — it’s better to avoid asking.

The memo below was sent to the team at Tiny Speck, the makers of Slack, on July 31st, 2013. It had been a little under seven months since development began and was two weeks before the launch of Slack’s ‘Preview Release’. It is presented verbatim, as written (including original pull-quotes), with two exceptions: the removal of an introductory section discussing launch logistics and replacement of a link which pointed to an internal company resource with the equivalent public link.
Build Something People Want
We know that we have built something which is genuinely useful: almost any team which adopts Slack as their central application for communication would be significantly better off than they were before. That means we have something people want.
However, almost all of them have no idea that they want Slack. How could they? They’ve never heard of it. And only a vanishingly small number will have imagined it on their own. They think they want something different (if they think they want anything at all). They definitely are not looking for Slack. (But then no-one was looking for Post-it notes or GUIs either.)
Just as much as our job is to build something genuinely useful, something which really does make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive, our job is also to understand what people think they want and then translate the value of Slack into their terms.
A good part of that is “just marketing,” but even the best slogans, ads, landing pages, PR campaigns, etc., will fall down if they are not supported by the experience people have when they hit our site, when they sign up for an account, when they first begin using the product and when they start using it day in, day out.
Therefore, “understanding what people think they want and then translating the value of Slack into their terms” is something we all work on. It is the sum of the exercise of all our crafts. We do it with copy accompanying signup forms, with fast-loading pages, with good welcome emails, with comprehensive and accurate search, with purposeful loading screens, and with thoughtfully implemented and well-functioning features of all kinds.
“Marketing from Both Ends”
Much has been written about “product-market fit” in the last few years, probably as a result of the popularity of the lean startup movement (though the idea has been around much longer). The term refers to the degree to which a product could be successful, given sufficient promotion, appropriate pricing, adequate customer support and so on (before you find that fit, all the pushing in the world won’t get you up the hill).
In this classic post on Marc Andreessen’s old blog, he calls getting to product-market fit the “only thing that matters” for startups and offers a way of thinking about the life of the startup that divides it into two distinct phases: before product-market fit and after. Once the product fits the market, a company is able to step on the gas, spending to promote a product that will actually sell. The things you need to do before are very different from the things you need to do after (generally test &#x26; iterate vs scale &#x26; optimize).
We are right in the middle of that first phase. It seems we are doing well and there are many encouraging signs, but we’re definitely still in the first phase and it is very, very hard to tell how far we have to go to cross over into the promised land (the last 10% is 90% of the work, etc.) So, we should be working carefully from both the product end and the market end:
Doing a better and better job of providing what people want (whether they know it or not)
Communicating the above more and more effectively (so that they know they want it)
In the best case, there is a dialectic at play here: the product itself and the way people use it should suggest new ways of articulating the value — and refinements to how we communicate the value should lead to principles which clarify decision-making around product features and design.
Our position is different than the one many new companies find themselves in: we are not battling it out in a large, well-defined market with clear incumbents (which is why we can’t get away with “Other group chat products are poisonous. Slack is toasted.”). Despite the fact that there are a handful of direct competitors and a muddled history of superficially similar tools, we are setting out to define a new market. And that means we can’t limit ourselves to tweaking the product; we need to tweak the market too.</p>
<p>Sell the innovation, not the product
The best — maybe the only? — real, direct measure of “innovation” is change in human behaviour. In fact, it is useful to take this way of thinking as definitional: innovation is the sum of change across the whole system, not a thing which causes a change in how people behave. No small innovation ever caused a large shift in how people spend their time and no large one has ever failed to do so.
By that measure, Slack is a real and large innovation. It is not as eye-catching as self-driving cars or implantable chips — it is not basic research-y kind of stuff. But, for organizations that adopt it, there will be a dramatic shift in how time is spent, how communication happens, and how the team’s archives are utilized. There will be changes in how team members relate to one another and, hopefully, significant changes in productivity.
We are unlikely to be able to sell “a group chat system” very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat system (and, as pointed out elsewhere, our current fax machine works fine).
That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation.
What we are selling is not the software product — the set of all the features, in their specific implementation — because there are just not many buyers for this software product. (People buy “software” to address a need they already know they have or perform some specific task they need to perform, whether that is tracking sales contacts or editing video.)
However, if we are selling “a reduction in the cost of communication” or “zero effort knowledge management” or “making better decisions, faster” or “all your team communication, instantly searchable, available wherever you go” or “75% less email” or some other valuable result of adopting Slack, we will find many more buyers.
That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation. The software just happens to be the part we’re able to build &#x26; ship (and the means for us to get our cut).
We’re selling a reduction in information overload, relief from stress, and a new ability to extract the enormous value of hitherto useless corporate archives. We’re selling better organizations, better teams. That’s a good thing for people to buy and it is a much better thing for us to sell in the long run. We will be successful to the extent that we create better teams.
To see why, consider the hypothetical Acme Saddle Company. They could just sell saddles, and if so, they’d probably be selling on the basis of things like the quality of the leather they use or the fancy adornments their saddles include; they could be selling on the range of styles and sizes available, or on durability, or on price.
Or, they could sell horseback riding. Being successful at selling horseback riding means they grow the market for their product while giving the perfect context for talking about their saddles. It lets them position themselves as the leader and affords them different kinds of marketing and promotion opportunities (e.g., sponsoring school programs to promote riding to kids, working on land conservation or trail maps). It lets them think big and potentially be big.
Because the best possible way to find product-market fit
is to define your own market.
This isn’t a new idea. There are many brands whose marketing activities or positioning has them selling something other than (and usually larger than) their product: Harley Davidson sells motorcycle riding, but it especially sells freedom and independence. Most luxury brands sell something that comes down to “being better than you are” (richer, better looking, more attractive to those you find desirable, etc.)
My favorite recent example is Lululemon: when they started, there was not a large market for yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories. They sold yoga like crazy: helping people find yoga studios near their homes, hosting free classes, sponsorships and scholarships, local ambassadors and training, etc. And as a result, they sold just under $1.4 billion worth of yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories in their most recent fiscal year.
But going back to the Acme Saddle Company, the better analogy to what we are doing now is to imagine them selling horseback riding … about 4,000 years ago. It is almost inevitable that centralized internal communication systems will gradually replace email for most organizations over the next 10-20 years and we should do what we can to accelerate the trend and “own it”. We are at the beginning of a transition. We have an opportunity to both define the category and push hard for the whole market’s growth. We’d be crazy not to take it, because the best possible way to find product-market fit is to define your own market.
Who Do We Want Our Customers to Become?
A few months ago, I read a fairly mediocre ebook called “Who Do You Want Your Customers to Become?” (available here). It was mediocre because it was nearly 70 pages when it could have been 20, not because the ideas were bad: in fact, the core ideas of the piece are fascinating and, I think, very useful to us as we think about the next year or so of Slack.
A central thesis is that all products are asking things of their customers: to do things in a certain way, to think of themselves in a certain way — and usually that means changing what one does or how one does it; it often means changing how one thinks of oneself.
We are asking a lot from our customers. We are asking them to spend hours a day in a new and unfamiliar application, to give up on years or even decades of experience using email for work communication (and abandon all kinds of ad hoc workflows that have developed around their use of email). We are asking them to switch a model of communication which defaults to public; it is an almost impossibly large ask. Almost.
To get people to say yes to a request that large, we need to (1) offer them a reward big enough to justify their effort and (2) do an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution.
The best way to imagine the reward is thinking about who we want our customers to become:
We want them to become relaxed, productive workers who have the confidence that comes from knowing that any bit of information which might be valuable to them is only a search away.
We want them to become masters of their own information and not slaves, overwhelmed by the neverending flow.
We want them to feel less frustrated by a lack of visibility into what is going on with their team.
We want them to become people who communicate purposively, knowing that each question they ask is actually building value for the whole team.
This is what we have to be able to offer them, and it is the aim and purpose of all the work we are doing. We need to make them understand what’s at the end of the rainbow if they go with Slack, and then we have to work our asses off in order to ensure they get there.
How Do We Do It?
We do it really, really fucking good.
The reason for saying we need to do ‘an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution’ is this: When you want something really bad, you will put up with a lot of flaws. But if you do not yet know you want something, your tolerance will be much lower. That’s why it is especially important for us to build a beautiful, elegant and considerate piece of software. Every bit of grace, refinement, and thoughtfulness on our part will pull people along. Every petty irritation will stop them and give the impression that it is not worth it.
That means we have to find all those petty irritations, and quash them. We need to look at our own work from the perspective of a new potential customer and actually see what’s there. Does it make sense? Can you predict what’s going to happen when you click that button or open that menu? Is there sufficient feedback to know if the click or tap worked? Is it fast enough? If I read the email on my phone and click the link, is it broken?
None of the work we are doing to develop
the product is an end in itself.
It is always harder to do this with one’s own product: we skip over the bad parts knowing that we plan to fix it later. We already know the model we’re using and the terms we use to describe it. It is very difficult to approach Slack with beginner’s mind. But we have to, all of us, and we have to do it every day, over and over and polish every rough edge off until this product is as smooth as lacquered mahogany.
Each of you knows “really good”. Each of you is able to see when things are not done well. Certainly we all complain enough about other people’s software, and we all know how important first impressions are in our own judgements. That is exactly how others will evaluate us.
Putting yourself in the mind of someone who is coming to Slack for the first time — especially a real someone, who is being made to try this thing by their boss, who is already a bit hangry because they didn’t have time for breakfast, and who is anxious about finishing off a project before they take off for the long weekend — putting yourself in their mind means looking at Slack the way you look at some random piece of software in which you have no investment and no special interest. Look at it hard, and find the things that do not work. Be harsh, in the interest of being excellent.
Why?
There’s no point doing this to be small. We should go big, if only because there are a lot of people in the world who deserve Slack. Going big also means that it will have to be really, really good. But that’s convenient, since there’s also no point doing it if it is not really, really good. Life is too short to do mediocre work and it is definitely too short to build shitty things.
To do this well, we need to take a holistic approach and not just think about a long list of individual tasks we are supposed to get through in a given week. We get 0 points for just getting a feature out the door if it is not actually contributing to making the experience better for users, or helping them to understand Slack, or helping us understand them. None of the work we are doing to develop the product is an end in itself; it all must be squarely aimed at the larger purpose.
Consider the teams you see in action at great restaurants, and the totality of their effort: the room, the vibe, the timing, the presentation, the attention, the anticipation of your needs (and, of course, the food itself); nothing can be off. There is a great nobility in being of service to others, and well-run restaurants (or hotels, or software companies) serve with a quality that is measured by its attention to detail. This is a perfect model for us to emulate.
Ensuring that the pieces all come together is not someone else’s job. It is your job, no matter what your title is and no matter what role you play. The pursuit of that purpose should permeate everything we do.
But Slack is a bit more complicated than a restaurant (at least in some ways). Since it is new and less familiar, we are less able to fall back on well-established best practices. That means we need to listen, watch &#x26; analyze carefully. We’ll need to build tools to capture users’ behaviour and reactions. And then we’ll need to take all that information and our best instincts and be continuously improving.
We are an exceptional software development team. But, we now also need be an excellent customer development team. That’s why, in the first section of this doc, I said “build a customer base” rather than “gain market share”: the nature of the task is different, and we will work together to understand, anticipate and better serve the people who trust us with their teams’ communications, one customer at a time.
The answer to “Why?” is “because why the fuck else would you even want to be alive but to do things as well as you can?”. Now: let’s do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager">https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager</a>
Because I teach a course on product management at Harvard Business School, I am routinely asked “What is the role of a product manager?” The role of product manager (PM) is often referred to as the “CEO of the product.” I disagree because, as Martin Eriksson points out, “Product managers simply don’t have any direct authority over most of the things needed to make their products successful — from user and data research through design and development to marketing, sales, and support.” PMs are not the CEO of product, and their roles vary widely depending on a number of factors. So, what should you consider if you’re thinking of pursuing a PM role?</p>
<p>Aspiring PMs should consider three primary factors when evaluating a role: core competencies, emotional intelligence (EQ), and company fit. The best PMs I have worked with have mastered the core competencies, have a high EQ, and work for the right company for them. Beyond shipping new features on a regular cadence and keeping the peace between engineering and the design team, the best PMs create products with strong user adoption that have exponential revenue growth and perhaps even disrupt an industry.</p>
<p>Core Competencies
There are core competencies that every PM must have — many of which can start in the classroom — but most are developed with experience, good role models, and mentoring. Some examples of these competencies include:</p>
<p>conducting customer interviews and user testing
running design sprints
feature prioritization and road map planning
the art of resource allocation (it is not a science!)
performing market assessments
translating business-to-technical requirements, and vice versa
pricing and revenue modeling
defining and tracking success metrics
These core competencies are the baseline for any PM, and the best PMs hone these skills over years of defining, shipping, and iterating on products. These PMs excel at reflecting on where each of these competencies have contributed to the success or failure of their products and continuously adjusting their approach based on customer feedback.</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence
A good PM may know the dos and don’ts of a customer interview, but the best PMs have the ability to empathize with customers in that interview, are tuned into their body language and emotions, and can astutely suss out the pain points that the product or feature will address. A PM with a high EQ has strong relationships within their organization and a keen sense of how to navigate both internal and external hurdles to ship a great product. Here’s a deeper look at how the four key traits of EQ, as defined by Daniel Goleman, relate to the PM role:</p>
<p>Relationship management. Probably one of the most important characteristics of a great PM is their relationship management skills. By forming authentic and trustworthy connections with both internal and external stakeholders, the best PMs inspire people and help them reach their full potential. Relationship management is also vital in successful negotiation, resolving conflicts, and working with others toward a shared goal, which is especially challenging when a PM is tasked with balancing the needs of customers, resource-constrained engineering teams, and the company’s revenue goals. Authentic and trusting relationships within an organization can lead to more support when additional funding is needed for a product or when an engineer must be swayed to include a quick bug fix in the next sprint. Outside an organization, these skills could encourage existing customers to beta test a new feature for early feedback or to convince a target customer to try the MVP of a product still in stealth mode. These relationship skills can also be what makes the difference between having irate customers because of a bug introduced into the product and those who say, “No worries, we know you’ll fix this!”</p>
<p>Self-awareness. PMs must be self-aware so as to remain objective and avoid projecting their own preferences onto users of their products. If a PM is in love with a feature because it addresses their own pain points — PMs are often super-users of the products for which they are responsible — they may cause a user to say they love it too, just to please the PM (“false positive feature validation”). If not self-aware, a PM may push to prioritize a feature they conceived even when all the customer interviews and evidence are stacked against it. This lack of self-awareness could derail more important priorities or damage the PM’s relationship with engineers, who may lose confidence in their PM when the feature isn’t readily adopted by users.</p>
<p>Self-management. Being a PM can be incredibly stressful. The CEO wants one thing, the engineering team another, and customers have their own opinions about feature priorities. Managing tight deadlines, revenue targets, market demands, prioritization conflicts, and resource constraints all at once is not for the faint of heart. If a PM cannot maintain their emotions and keep it cool under pressure, they can quickly lose the confidence of all their constituents. The best PMs know how to push hard on the right priorities, with urgency but without conveying a sense of panic or stress. These PMs also know when to take a breath and step away to regroup.</p>
<p>Social awareness. According to Goleman, the competencies associated with being socially aware are empathy, organizational awareness, and service. PMs must understand customers’ emotions and concerns about their product as much as they understand the concerns of the sales team on how to sell that product, or the support team on how to support it, or the engineering team on how to build it. PMs have to have a deep understanding of how the organization operates and must build social capital to influence the success of their product, from obtaining budget and staffing to securing a top engineer to work on their product. Finally, social awareness ensures the best PMs service their customers with a product that addresses their jobs to be done, which is ultimately what drives product-market fit.</p>
<p>(Read more about what Paul Jackson has to say about EQ and PMs here. And here’s an interview with Sam Lessin, former VP of product management at Facebook, who says he has “never successfully trained empathy.”)</p>
<p>Company Fit
If the best PMs have well-developed core competencies and a high EQ, does that mean they are destined for success no matter where they work? Not necessarily. In fact, taking these skills and personality traits and applying them to the right company is what will ultimately guarantee success.</p>
<p>I have yet to see a standard job description for a product manager, because each role is ultimately defined by the size, type of product, stage, industry, and even culture of the company. If you possess the core competencies and high EQ needed to be a successful PM, the next step is to unpack who’s hiring and what they are truly looking for.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the key areas in which companies differ in what they want from a PM:</p>
<p>Technical skill. The type of product, who uses it, and the type of company will determine how technical a PM needs to be. For example, Google requires PMs to pass a technical skills test regardless of what product they’ll work on. If the company is building a SaaS CRM, there may be more requirements around experience with go-to-market and customer lifecycles than around how the product is built. By contrast, if it’s a data science product with machine learning algorithms and APIs, the role may require a lot more technical depth to not only understand how to build the product but also how to talk credibly with the customers who will use it. That said, having a basic technical understanding of what is under the hood and mastery of the tools that PMs use is definitely important for the role, anywhere it is. Colin Lernell has more to say about these necessary skills here. If you are an aspiring PM and are concerned that you lack the basic tech skills for the role, you might consider taking online courses such as the renowned Introduction to Computer Science (CS50) course offered by Harvard University or one of the many intro and advanced technology courses offered by The Flatiron School.</p>
<p>Company philosophy about PM. Every company has a different philosophy about the product development process and where PMs fit into that process. Below are the three most common types, with pros and cons:</p>
<p>PM drives engineering. This is a “throw it over the wall” approach, where PMs gather requirements, write the quintessential product requirements document, and hand it off to engineering to spec out the technical requirements. Contemporary organizations may do this process in a more agile and collaborative way, but the expectation is that PMs know best about what customers need and engineering is there to serve.
Pro: Engineering can focus on coding without a lot of distraction; this tends to work well for Waterfall development shops with long lifecycles.
Con: Engineers lose sight of the big picture and do not develop empathy for customers, which can lead to a poor user experience. Often there are unhealthy tensions when technical debt and “plumbing” work needs to be prioritized over customer requirements.
Engineering drives product. More technically oriented product companies (cloud, big data, networking) tend to be engineering-driven, where engineers are advancing the science in their domain and PMs validate solutions or create front end access points (UIs, APIs) to tap into this new technology. There can be a collaborative relationship and feedback loop between customers, PMs, and engineering, but typically PMs are serving engineering in these companies.
Pro: Breakthrough technology can offer customers things they didn’t even know they needed. VMotion at VMware was a great example of this. An engineer thought it would be cool to do, a PM figured out how to monetize it, and it became a billion-dollar game changer for the company.
Con: Engineers chase the shiny new thing, over-architect the solution, or iterate forever, seeking perfection before getting customer feedback. PM input on priorities is ignored, which sometimes includes the most basic needs of customers.
The PM-engineering partnership. In these cases, there is a strong yin-yang between PM and engineering, with joint discovery, decision making, and shared accountability. Engineers join PMs in customer interviews, and PMs are in sprint meetings to help unblock tasks or clarify requirements. But the two roles respect the line where one starts and the other stops. PMs understand what’s being coded but don’t tell engineers how to code, and engineers have empathy for customers’ needs but leave the prioritization to the PMs.
Pro: A streamlined prioritization process that values technical debt and plumbing projects; better design processes leading to a more positive user experience; higher-performing teams with improved product velocity, quality, and, typically, happier customers.
Con: Breakthrough innovation may not get greenlit; time-to-market may seem to lag (though I’d argue that what’s released is far better aligned with customer needs and more likely to successfully scale).
I’m clearly biased in favor of the third type of philosophy about PM (as is venture capitalist Fred Wilson), as I’ve experienced all three and found the yin-yang to be most effective. But that’s not to say the others are notably bad — it really depends on what type of product you’re building, the company stage, and more. Regardless, when considering a PM role, the philosophy of PM at the company could be the deciding factor on fit for the role.</p>
<p>Stage of company. The role of the PM at a startup is far more likely to be responsible for “all the things,” whereas at a mature company their role will be more distinctly defined. (Banfield, Eriksson, and Walkingshaw’s book Product Leadership has a section that has a lot more detail on this topic.)</p>
<p>Startup. Beyond discovery, definition, and shipping, PMs may also be responsible for pricing, marketing, support, and potentially even sales of the product. These PMs thrive in a scrappy environment and are comfortable with ambiguity and frequent changes to direction as the company works towards product-market fit and learns to operate at scale.
Pro: PMs are likely to be more involved with company strategy, get exposure to senior leadership and the board, are able to take more risks and make a bigger impact. They also have more influence and authority over company resources.
Con: There’s typically little to no mentorship, role models, or best practices within the company. (You may have to seek it externally.) Budgets are typically tight, and PMs may not have the requisite experience to succeed at some of the things they’re tasked to do.
Mature company. The PM may have a narrower scope and have coworkers who handle pricing, go-to-market strategies, and so on. And they are likely to be part of a larger team of product managers.
Pro: PMs are more likely to have mentoring and role models, as well as development standards and best practices. Close association with an engineering team can create strong relationships over time, which is great for long-term impact and career growth. And if the product has market fit, there is an established customer base and performance baseline to work from, versus guessing until you get it right.
Con: PMs have less exposure to company strategy and are just one of many voices of the customer. They can get “lost” in the system and have to deal with more politics and tight budgets.
Founder/CTO/CEO relationship with PM. Especially in earlier-stage companies, it’s important to know how involved the founder/CEO/CTO is in the product process. If they are deeply involved, the PM role may play more of a support role, to flesh out their ideas or validate concepts with customers, versus conceiving and driving ideas of their own. This can be great fun for some PMs who enjoy partnering with founders and C-level executives and collaborating on the product evolution. But for other PMs, it can be very frustrating if they prefer to take more ownership of the product direction. It can also be challenging if the more technical founders or C-levels prefer working directly with engineers. This can leave PMs out of the loop or undermined (sometimes unintentionally), causing not just personal frustrations but delays. When considering a PM role that may work closely with the founding leadership team, be sure to find out their expectations of the PM function and decide whether this is the right fit with your interests.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many other factors to consider for any role, such as the type of product you are building (B2B, B2C, industry), the people with whom you’ll work, the overall company culture (diverse, inclusive, flexible work hours, remote culture), and, of course, the compensation and benefits. There are also lots of articles on hiring product managers to get perspective on what the hiring managers are looking for — I especially recommend my friend Ken Norton’s piece “How to Hire a Product Manager.” However, if you are striving to be a great product manager, consider all of the above before signing on to your next gig. Developing core competencies will be an ongoing activity throughout your career, and leveraging EQ will ensure a more positive experience. But where you work, how they work, and who you work with and for will ultimately determine your long-term success.</p>
<p>RICE: Simple prioritization for product manager
Prioritization is a perennial challenge when building a product roadmap. How do you decide what to work on first?
If you’ve put the effort into brainstorming new ideas, finding opportunities for improvement, and collecting feedback, you’ll have a solid product roadmap full of good ideas. But the order in which you tackle those ideas deserves just as much thought. You need to take the time to prioritize well.</p>
<p>Resolution-Bot-Ad
Prioritization is a difficult problem
So why is prioritizing a product roadmap so difficult? Let me count the ways:</p>
<p>It’s satisfying to work on pet ideas you’d use yourself, instead of projects with broad reach.
It’s tempting to focus on clever ideas, instead of projects that directly impact your goals.
It’s exciting to dive into new ideas, instead of projects that you’re already confident about.
It’s easy to discount the additional effort that one project will require over another.
Even if you make it through this mental minefield intact, you’re left with the tough task of consistently combining and comparing these factors across all project ideas. Thankfully, you don’t have to do this in your head.</p>
<p>RICE score: a simple tool for prioritization
RICE
This is where a scoring system comes in. A good prioritization framework can help you consider each factor about a project idea with clear-eyed discipline and combine those factors in a rigorous, consistent way.</p>
<p>Using a scoring system for prioritization in product management certainly isn’t new. Systems designed to balance costs and benefits abound. But you can have a hard time finding one that allows you to usefully compare different ideas in a consistent way.</p>
<p>In response, we began developing our own scoring system for prioritization from first principles. After lots of testing and iteration, we settled on four factors, and a method for combining them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/">https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/</a>
RICE: Four factors for assessing priority
RICE is an acronym for the four factors we use to evaluate each project idea: reach, impact, confidence and effort.</p>
<p>Reach</p>
<p>To avoid bias towards features you’d use yourself, estimate how many people each project will affect within a given period. For my team, it’s “how many customers will this project impact over a single quarter?”.</p>
<p>Reach is measured in number of people/events per time period. That might be “customers per quarter” or “transactions per month”. As much as possible, use real measurements from product metrics instead of pulling numbers from a hat.</p>
<p>Example
Project 1: 500 customers reach this point in the signup funnel each month, and 30% choose this option. The reach is 500 × 30% × 3 = 450 customers per quarter.
Project 2: Every customer who uses this feature each quarter will see this change. The reach is 2,000 customers per quarter.
Project 3: This change will have a one-time effect on 800 existing customers, with no ongoing effect. The reach is 800 customers per quarter.
Impact</p>
<p>To focus on projects that move the needle on your goal, estimate the impact on an individual person. For my team, it’s “how much will this project increase conversion rate when a customer encounters it?”. Your team might replace this with another goal, such as “increase adoption”, or “maximize delight”.</p>
<p>Impact is difficult to measure precisely. So, I choose from a multiple-choice scale: 3 for “massive impact”, 2 for “high”, 1 for “medium”, 0.5 for “low”, and finally 0.25 for “minimal”. These numbers get multiplied into the final score to scale it up or down.</p>
<p>Choosing an impact number may seem unscientific. But remember the alternative: a tangled mess of gut feeling.</p>
<p>Example
Project 1: For each customer who sees it, this will have a huge impact. The impact score is 3.
Project 2: This will have a lesser impact for each customer. The impact score is 1.
Project 3: This is somewhere in-between in terms of impact. The impact score is 2.
Confidence</p>
<p>To curb enthusiasm for exciting but ill-defined ideas, factor in your level of confidence about your estimates. If you think a project could have huge impact but don’t have data to back it up, confidence lets you control that.</p>
<p>Confidence is a percentage, and I use another multiple-choice scale to help avoid decision paralysis. 100% is “high confidence”, 80% is “medium”, 50% is “low”. Anything below that is “total moonshot”. Be honest with yourself: how much support do you really have for your estimates?</p>
<p>Example
Project 1: We have quantitative metrics for reach, user research for impact, and an engineering estimate for effort. This project gets a 100% confidence score.
Project 2: I have data to support the reach and effort, but I’m unsure about the impact. This project gets an 80% confidence score.
Project 3: The reach and impact may be lower than estimated, and the effort may be higher. This project gets a 50% confidence score.
Effort</p>
<p>To move quickly and have impact with the least amount of effort, estimate the total amount of time a project will require from all members of your team: product, design, and engineering.</p>
<p>Effort is estimated as a number of “person-months” – the work that one team member can do in a month. There are many unknowns here, so I keep my estimates rough by sticking to whole numbers (or 0.5 for anything well under a month). Unlike the other positive factors, more effort is a bad thing, so it divides the total impact.</p>
<p>Example
Project 1: This will take about a week of planning, 1-2 weeks of design, and 2-4 weeks of engineering time. I’ll give it an effort score of 2 person-months.
Project 2: This project will take several weeks of planning, a significant amount of design time, and at least two months of one engineer’s time. I’ll give it an effort score of 4 person-months.
Project 3: This only requires a week of planning, no new design, and a few weeks of engineering time. I’ll give it an effort score of 1 person-month.
How is a RICE score calculated?
So, to quickly summarise our four factors:</p>
<p>Reach: how many people will this impact? (Estimate within a defined time period.)
Impact: how much will this impact each person? (Massive = 3x, High = 2x, Medium = 1x, Low = 0.5x, Minimal = 0.25x.)
Confidence: how confident are you in your estimates? (High = 100%, Medium = 80%, Low = 50%.)
Effort: how many “person-months” will this take? (Use whole numbers and minimum of half a month – don’t get into the weeds of estimation.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve estimated these factors, combine them into a single score so you can compare projects at a glance. Here’s the simple formula:</p>
<p>The resulting score measures “total impact per time worked” – exactly what we’d like to maximize. I set up a spreadsheet to automatically calculate the score for me as I estimate each factor.</p>
<p>Feel free to duplicate the spreadsheet for your own use. Or download an .xls version.</p>
<p>Once the initial scoring is done, sort your list and re-evaluate. Are there projects where the score seems too high or too low? If so, reconsider your estimates and make changes, or accept that your gut instinct may be wrong.</p>
<p>RICE can help immensely when deciding between hard-to-compare ideas. It forces you to think about why a project idea will have impact, and to be honest about the effort that’s needed to achieve it.</p>
<p>How to use RICE scores effectively
Of course, RICE scores shouldn’t be used as a hard and fast rule. There are many reasons why you might work on a project with a lower score first. One project may be a dependency for another project, so it needs to happen first, or another feature might be “table stakes” to sell to certain customers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might want or need to work on projects “out of order”. And that’s okay! With a scoring system in place, you can clearly identify when you’re making these trade-offs.</p>
<p>A prioritization framework such as RICE will help you make better-informed decisions about what to work on first and defend those decisions to others. Give RICE a try in your own prioritization process and let us know how it works for you.</p>

Anyone who’s worked in software development in the last five years has probably heard the term MVP. A lot. And if you are responsible for the user experience, chances are you’re often frustrated by these three letters. Probably because you usually encounter them closer to the end of the project, in sentences like this one: “It’s a great idea but we just can’t build it right now. Let’s launch the MVP and add this later.” Sometimes you hear that even if there are no plans for future iterations.
Isn’t it ironic that the concept, which should help us quickly build products our customers love, has instead become an excuse to ship products we’re not proud of?
The most common definition of Minimal Viable Product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. Unfortunately, sometimes this statement is misunderstood and teams think that building “just enough” means focusing purely on functionality. However, a product is more than the sum of its features. You can’t just ship something functional and wait for the next iteration to make it usable. User trust is fragile and once it’s broken it’s hard to rebuild.
The model below, originally proposed by Jussi Pasanen (which later became the artifact of any blog post on the topic), explains how not to disappoint your users while getting the product to them as quickly as possible. It suggests that instead of building layer by layer, you should be creating the minimum piece across each layer. Any MVP must have a set of features that gives users: enough value, a reliability level that earns their trust, and a usability level that allows them not to think about your design and to sprinkle a bit of joy on top.
In this article, I want to share my thoughts on how to find those minimal pieces that you need to build.</p>
<p>Minimum Viable Product: Build a slice across, instead of one layer at a time. Based on the diagram by Jussi Pasanen.
What is missing
There is another idea that this diagram captures very well. Product layers are stacked and if you extend the scope of one layer you will increase the scope of all the layers above it. For instance, the more we add new functionality, the more work we invite to keep the product reliable and easy to use. If we want to reduce the scope, the most sensible place to start is at the foundation of this pyramid — functionality.
So what features do we want to include? How do we decide? I know your UX spidey senses are tingling now. Mine did too, until I realized that the “functional layer” is a false bottom of this pyramid. The diagram above covers only characteristics of a product itself, but products don’t exist in a vacuum. We build them to help people who will hopefully pay us back for the provided value. The real foundation layers for your product are your audience and their needs.</p>
<p>Narrow your audience
Let’s say we want a product that solves problem X for our users. Which segments of our users should we build the MVP for to validate our approach? This question should be driving the negotiation on the scope of the project. Nothing can cut the development time more significantly than selecting “your audience” (whoever will get the most value from the product in its initial phase ) and saying no (or “not now”) to everyone else. The broader your audience, the more needs and problems it has, the more features you must build, and the more complex and hard-to-use your product will be.
Nothing can cut the development time more significantly than selecting “your audience”
There is a saying that points out that your MVP doesn’t have to be as cool as a final product, but the experience of using it should still be enjoyable: “The MVP of a car is a tricycle, not four wheels.”</p>
<p>The broader your audience, the more needs and problems it has, and the more complex your product will be.
But if you glance under the hood of this MVP you’ll see that the biggest difference it has from the finished product is the breadth of users it serves. A car is for everyone: old and young, those who travel alone or in a group, those who commute to work or carpool to the next town. A tricycle, however, exclusively serves the transportation needs of toddlers.
Segmenting your users, and choosing which needs of each segment you want to fulfill, allows your team to double-down on creating a great experience for those users and winning their love.
When you narrow down the bottom layer of your pyramid, every other layer shrinks as well.
Know their expectations
Let’s get back to the pyramid and take a look at the line that cuts across all layers and separates the “minimum” from the rest of the product. It’s clearly important as it outlines the scope of your work. How do you know where to draw it? I think this line indicates users’ expectations. Whatever audience you choose, they will have beliefs about what your product should be and do, and you can’t afford to fall short of their expectations.</p>
<p>The scope of your MVP is basically a function of your audience and their expectations.
It’s crucial to recognize the difference between what users want and what they expect. “Expectation” is how people believe something should work, while “want” is their desire for improvements on the current state of things. Coming up short on wants can be bad, but not meeting expectations can be a disaster. For instance, if it usually takes you half-an-hour to get to work, you would expect it to take you about the same amount of time tomorrow. Would you like your trip to be shorter? Of course, but you know that you don’t always get what you want. However, if your streetcar shows up 15 minutes late tomorrow, and your ride turns into 45 minutes, you might go ballistic.
Any product, not just MVP versions, will never satisfy all of your users’ wishes. There’s always room for improvement! However, when your product doesn’t meet user expectations, it’s a quick road to failure. When trying to identify user expectations, there are a few things you should keep in mind.
Users base their expectations on their experience with similar products
As long as you are not developing something absolutely new (think flying cars) you have to consider the experience that your competitors (even indirect ones) provide. If they sync user data immediately, then a 4-hour delay in your app might just not cut it. It might push you to draw the line on the diagram a bit more to the right and increase the scope of your project.
Users base their expectations on modern standards
Ten years ago you could get away with building a product that works only on desktop, but today it’s a given that it has to be accessible on mobile. A product that fails to support users when they are on-the-go probably doesn’t check the mark for “reliability” by today’s standards.
Users base their expectations on the solutions they use today
I love the example Jared Spool gives in his blog post about user expectations. His team did a usability study on Google Spreadsheets and observed the bookkeeper getting really frustrated when she couldn’t find a way to indicate a double underline. Could she use a regular underline? Technically yes, but the practice of double underlines for grand totals predates computers and spreadsheets, and your attempt to limit the scope of your MVP is just not a good enough reason to ignore that.
Summary
Building an MVP is not about cutting features, but about finding the minimum product you must build for the minimum audience you’ve defined.
Narrowing down what types of users you want to help goes a long way, as it will cut what needs you have to fulfill.
What your audience expects from your product will define how much scope you will have to take on. Find these expectations, and you can pretty much figure out what to build.
